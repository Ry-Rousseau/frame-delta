# Project Context: Frame Divergence Analyzer

## 1. The Goal
To build a lightweight, real-time tool that quantifies "Framing Bias" between news sources.
* **Input:** Two URLs (e.g., CNN vs. Fox News on the same topic).
* **Process:** Scrape text -> Classify into 15 Political Frames -> Calculate "Frame Delta."
* **Output:** "Source A focuses on *Morality* (60%), Source B focuses on *Economics* (40%)."

## 2. The Architecture
* **Model:** `distilbert-base-uncased` (Fine-tuned for Multi-Label Classification).
* **Task:** Multi-Label Text Classification (15 specific political frames).
* **Hardware:** Single GPU (16GB VRAM).

## 3. The Dataset
* **Source:** `copenlu/mm-framing` (Hugging Face).
* **Method:** We use the *text* portion of this dataset.
* **Labels:** The 15 standard Media Frames Corpus labels (Economic, Capacity, Morality, etc.).
* **Note:** The dataset labels were generated by Mistral-7B; we are "distilling" them into DistilBERT.

## Down-stream evaluation

After framing prediction model is completed, then we might evaluate it on a key real world benchmark- the

Always avoid emojis

I'm working in a conda environment called torch-gpu, when running bash commands, firstly please run:
conda activate torch-gpu

this will activate torch-gpu in your own environment

avoid creating uni-task scripts, including scripts for minute technical tasks. If you do, then please delete them after they have served their purpose.
