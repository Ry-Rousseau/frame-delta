Immigration1.0-34846,'We've Lost Control of Our Borders',1981,8,new york times,,section 4,599.0,"After several false starts, President Reagan has finally proposed his immigration reform. But the package is so disappointing one wonders what took so long. Key features are seriously flawed, almost ludicrously in the matter of regulating immigrant labor. Congress will not find it helpful in drafting legislation. And it displays an Administration so irresolute that it raises doubts about whether whatever Congress enacts will be fairly and vigorously enforced.
Editorial discusses President Reagan's proposed immigration reforms and expresses disappointment in key features regulating immigrant labor
Some facts are faced squarely. We have, as Attorney General Smith concedes, ''lost control of our borders.'' Uncounted millions cross our porous borders in search of a better life. Like prior immigrants, many enrich our land with industry. But their numbers are so great that they also strain community resources and threaten the jobs and well-being of those who preceded them.
Another bow to reality is Mr. Smith's concession that millions of illegals are here to stay and that some system has to be found to legitimize and integrate them.
But if the borders can't be closed, the key to control is jobs. A law that prohibits the employment of illegal aliens is a recognized necessity. But it will be a new mockery if Congress, like the Administration, flees from sufficient punishment for violators and from a realistic, fair way to detect violations.
Employers cannot be held accountable for whom they hire without a reliable way of verifying the immigration status - whether that be a forgery-proof Social Security card or some less expensive tool. An expert immigration commission recognized that fact, as did a White House task force. But for diverse reasons, including a misplaced concern over this extra measure of business regulation, the
Reagan Cabinet rejected the idea.  The emptiness of the proposed sanctions against employers is further betrayed by the proposed maximum penalty of $1,000 for each illegal hire - a mild cost of acquiring workers at many thousands below scale. Moreover, Mr. Smith would let employers avoid penalty altogether if they merely ask for such easily forged instruments as a driver's license and paper Social Security card.
By posing a costly and ominous-sounding ''national identity card'' as the only alternative, the Administration stacks the deck. Less expensive techniques are available, including a computer system of telephone verification. The President's concern for
''our values of individual privacy and freedom'' is welcome, but out of context. Forgery-proof identification need not invade privacy; but the lack of it could cost legal aliens their livelihoods.  Cynical employers can easily mask their discrimination against
Hispanics and other minorities by claiming uncertainty about immigration status.  Some sympathy is warranted for anyone who must wrestle with this vexing problem. All the issues - the nature and strength of border patrols, the intercepting of unwanted immigrants at sea, the standards for choosing refugees, the utility of an ''experiment'' in temporary guest worker employment - are mined with controversy and expense.
But it is hard to sympathize with an effort that failed so clearly on a central point. And if a dozen Cabinet officials can't reach accord on sound recom-mendations, what hope for 500 members of Congress?

Immigration1.0-34967,A Federal Jury Indicts 2 In Immigration Scheme,1981,2,new york times,,section b,222.0,"A Federal immigration investigator and a Long Island businessman were indicted yesterday on charges involving an immigration-fraud scheme in which the investigator allegedly sold his influence to help foreigners enter or remain in the United States. Law enforcement officials said the indictment was an indirect outgrowth of the Abscam investigation of corruption.
Federal immigration investigator and Long Island businessman are indicted in immigration-fraud scheme
A second businessman was cited as an unindicted co-conspirator in the alleged scheme. The 15-count indictment was handed up by a Federal grand jury in Brooklyn. The prosecutor in the case, Laura A.  Brevetti, said the three men had been promised a total of $15,800 in payments and had received $7,300 from various foreigners who were aided.
The defendants were identified as Gerard W. Gentile, 33 years old, of Commack, L.I., an investigator for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and Manuel Horacio Lima de Jesus, 40, of Great Neck, L.I., the businessman. The unindicted alleged coconspirator was identified as Dieter Schmidt, 36, a former businessman now living in Florida.
At their arraignment in Federal Court in Brooklyn last night, Mr.  Gentile and Mr. de Jesus pleaded not guilty and were released pending further court proceedings.

Immigration1.0-35240,A HELPING HAND FOR THE HAITIANS; Passaic resident is filling the role of honorary consul,1982,3,new york times,By DIANE FISKE,section 11,673.0,"PASSAIC TO Jean Claude Levy, honorary consul of Haiti in New Jersey, his title is not merely decorative. Rather, Mr. Levy, who is not a Haitian, sees himself as helping the thousands of Haitian immigrants in New Jersey who live in poverty. He considers his mission as one of assisting them in settling in a school or job.
The 38-year-old Mr. Levy lives at 110 Main Street here. He runs a secretarial school in East Orange called the First School, which teaches language skills in French and Spanish as well as typing, shorthand and the use of business machines. Many of his students are Haitian or Cuban.
Profile of Claude Levy, honorary consul of Haiti in New Jersey
Mr. Levy was born in Morocco and is still a French citizen. He first saw Haiti in 1971 while on his honeymoon.  ''My American wife and I looked at a map of the Caribbean - and there was Haiti,'' he recalled. ''I said, 'Let's have an adventure,' so we went to Haiti.
''It was love at first sight. I felt that, in many ways, Haiti is like Morocco. The climate and the people are very similar. The people are themselves and exist independently of the political climate.''
Noting that Haiti is only 70 miles from Cuba, Mr. Levy said he did not think that the United States should ''overlook a friendly country so close to its border.''
According to Mr. Levy, his secretarial school is the only American school with branches both in the United States and Haiti.  The status of many Haitians lies somewhere between immigrant and refugee, for the situation there does not present a sufficient emergency to permit them to be classified as people who have fled to avoid persecution.
Each Haitian must be granted asylum on an individual basis.  ''Many of these people are waiting for their standing to be determined before they register their children in American schools,'' Mr. Levy said. ''Meanwhile, they themselves cannot find work.''
Since September 1980, when he was appointed honorary consul, Mr.  Levy has been working with Representative James J. Florio, Democrat of Runnemede; Representative Peter W. Rodino, Democrat of Newark, and other members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation. They have been trying to get support for legislation that would allow Cuban and Haitian immigrants to be able to convert to permanent resident alien status after two years in this country.
Mr. Levy, who said that New Jersey's Haitians - they are second in number only to those in Florida and New York City - would like to establish a Haitian civic center in East Orange.
The center would acclimate the Haitians to American life and help them decide how to earn a living.  ''There is a need for schools in New Jersey to accommodate these Caribbean people,'' Mr. Levy said. ''I decided to take it upon myself in the mid-1970's to try to help educate these people, but there is much more to be done.''
Mr. Levy said that he traveled to Haiti 10 to 15 times a year and had conferred with President Jean-Claude Duvalier about the schools there.
''Haiti has the image of being a smiling, happy country where people are thinking poor,'' he said. ''We are trying to change that.''
According to a spokesman at the Haitian Embassy in Washington, many countries that cannot afford to establish consulates welcome people who wish to serve as honorary consuls.
An honorary consul cannot grant passports or carry out official duties. However, he can inform the public about the country he represents and help to establish a welcoming agency for people, such as Haitians, who arrive in this country.
''He (Mr. Levy) is there to promote Haiti in this country,'' the Haitian Embassy spokesman said. ''He was appointed by the ambassador as a non-full-time representative, and he seems to be doing a very good job of letting people know about Haiti.''

Immigration1.0-35262,A STATE OF LIMBO RULES THE LIVES OF POLISH ALIENS,1982,2,new york times,BY SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN,section 11,1496.0,"WHEN the immigration agents approached Helena shouting, ''Polish?  Polish?'' she felt no surprise, only the confirmation of her worst fears. She knew she possessed neither the valid visa nor the work permit - for her $64-a-week job cleaning offices - that the agents wanted to see. ''There was a risk,'' the 40-year-old former bookkeeper said of her Oct. 21, 1981 arrest here. ''I just took it.''
Deportation proceedings against Helena, who asked that her full name not be used, began Dec. 22 - even though military law had been declared in Poland nine days earlier. The proceedings will continue although the Reagan Administration, in the wake of the recent events in Poland, has barred the actual expulsion of illegal Polish aliens until March 31.
It is a strange sort of deliverance, Helena said; military rule, the very act that saves her from the possibility of a forcible return to Poland, makes her dread it even more. She feels, she said, that she has no country.
Discussion of deportation of Polish-illegal aliens in US
Helena's sense of limbo is shared by about a thousand illegal Polish aliens living, working and often hiding, in Connecticut, according to Ryszard S. Mrotek, a Hartford lawyer who specializes in immigration cases. Estimates of their number nationwide range from 20,000, according to Aloysius A. Mazewski, president of the Polish-American Congress, to 35,000, according to Richard W. Day, general counsel of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law.
Some 5,300 Poles nationwide currently are involved in ''expulsion proceedings,'' including detainment, deportation hearings, decisions on requests for asylum and denial of entry to the country, according to Duane Austin, an information officer for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service. He added that many of the illegal aliens also break labor, Social Security and tax laws by working ''off-the-books'' jobs - those that are not reported to Government officials.
Most Polish aliens first enter the United States on tourist visas, which last no more than six months, said immigration officials and Polish-American advocates. They generally live with relatives in the Polish enclaves of New Britain, Hartford, Stratford and large towns in Connecticut, although the greatest numbers are found in Chicago, Detroit and Pittsburgh. They work in relatively menial jobs - machine shops for men, garment factories or building maintenance for women - although the Poles range from unskilled workers to those with advanced degrees but no fluency in English. Most limit their movements to the passage from home to job, trying to avoid the periodic roundups made by immigration agents.
A suit brought by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, now in the pretrial stages in Federal District Court in Hartford, seeks an injunction against the ''random'' raids.
''Our people live like hunted game,'' contended Mr. Mrotek, a naturalized Pole. ''You stay as close as possible to the family, don't socialize much, don't talk at work, hide behind someone else's Social Security card, don't get a driver's license.''
The situation for Polish aliens changed significantly when Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1981. Until then, immigrants from Communist countries automatically received the status of refugees, allowing the influx of Poles and Soviet Jews in particular, Mr. Day said.
The new law, adopting verbatim the wording of a United Nations protocol, altered the definition of a refugee to a person with ''a well-founded fear of persecution, based on race, religion, national origin, or membership in any social organization.''
The definition appears to exclude most Polish aliens, Mr. Day said, because they came to the United States for economic gain.  ''What we hear about are food shortages, fuel shortages,'' he said, ''not political reasons.'' But Polish aliens rarely extricate the shortages from the Communist government that presides over the economy.
The existence of Solidarity further complicated the issue.  Immigration officials and lawmakers had pointed to the ascension of the independent trade union as proof of the absence of mass persecution in Poland, and deportations of illegal immigrants continued until the Dec. 13 declaration of martial law. On that day President Reagan ordered deportations halted, and the immigration service on Jan. 22 said no Poles would be returned home until at least March 31.
But expulsion hearings that began before Dec. 13 continue and the State Department has ''temporarily suspended consideration'' of requests for asylum, according to a letter to Mr. Mrotek from John D. Scanlan, deputy assistant secretary for European affairs. A blanket amnesty for Polish immigrants ''would be inconsistent with the Refugee Act,'' Mr. Scanlan wrote.
Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican of Wyoming who is chairman of the Senate immigration committee, said, ''We have to be very cautious about any broadening of the definition of 'refugee,' '' because, besides the Poles, thousands of Haitian and Salvadoran immigrants claim to have fled political persecution. He reiterated the wording from the Refugee Act, but then added, ''How do you deal with plain old fear?''
Mr. Simpson did not answer his own question. But Betty, a 32-yearold Polish alien living in Greenwich, could. She has lived ''underground'' - her word - for the seven years since her six-week tourist visa expired.
''I was simply hiding,'' she said. ''I couldn't take a job I'd like to, like an office job or nursing. I didn't get a driver's license.  I opened a savings account in my cousin's name.''
Betty said she tried several times to attain legal status, paying $1,000 to a lawyer who did not succeed in doing so, and seeking advice from Polish-American organizations. ''They told me, 'Immigration isn't looking for you, sit quiet,' '' she recalled.
But her conscience troubled her. Twice she bought airline tickets to Poland, only to return them. ''I feel very guilty about not paying taxes,'' she said, ''but I spend all my money here. I paid lawyers, I paid doctors, I was in the hospital and paid all my bills.''
She misses her family and blames herself because, she said, since her flight from Poland, her brother has been denied the right to work in Czechoslovakia and her father has been interrogated frequently by Polish officials.
Betty's mother, however, received a visa in December 1981 to visit Betty's aunt in Stamford. Then martial law was declared. Betty's mother wants to return home. Betty's aunt wants the 57-year-old woman to stay. Her visa expires this month.
Barbara, 29, a Polish immigrant in Hartford, also feels torn between family and freedom. She left her husband and children in Warsaw in June 1981 with the promise, ''See you in three months.'' Now she fears that returning to Poland means imprisonment because she had been a Solidarity organizer.
''I keep myself very busy,'' she said, ''or else I would go crazy.'' But work and her studies in computer science are not diversion enough. The strain of separation shows in the 15 pounds she has lost, the cigarettes she never before smoked.
One night recently, Barbara watched the movie, ''Man of Iron,'' which mixes a fictional plot with documentary footage of the Gdansk shipyard strike that gave birth to Solidarity.
''I feel how can this possibly be, that if I was there I would be in jail for my ideology,'' she said after the film. As the final credits slid off the screen, she looked at the spectators departing, and said: ''American people are nice, but they never can feel the same thing. It's not my country here. It never will be. I'm a stranger here.''
Barbara's problems, however, remain more emotional than legal. Her student visa and her affiliation with Solidarity - probably a boon in proving a ''well-founded fear of persecution'' and thus gaining asylum - are luxuries few other Polish aliens share.
Consider a 28-year-old seamstress in New Britain, who did not want to be identified. As she sat in her brother's apartment - legs drawn into her chest and locked into a defensive cocoon by linked arms - she told of the day of her arrest last June.
Three immigration agents came to her sewing machine in a New Britain factory, asking for her papers. She told them through an interpreter that she had a working permit and had applied for permanent residence, but did not have the documents with her.
The agents put her in their car. She thought they were taking her directly to the airport to be sent home. She went, in fact, to the Hartford immigration office for fingerprinting and mug shots, and then to the Connecticut Women's Correctional Institution in Niantic.  There she was held over night.
Her case remains in an immigration court. She contends that she has a valid work permit; immigration officials contend that she does not.  ''I can't go to Poland and I don't know if I can stay here,'' she said. ''The only choice is to look for another country.''

Immigration1.0-34843,ADVISER IN MEXICAN GOVERNMENT ASSAILS REAGAN IMMIGRATION PLAN,1981,8,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section a,677.0,"Mexico's leading expert on migration, Jorge Bustamante, criticized President Reagan's immigration proposals today, saying they served the interests of United States employers and would institutionalize the inferior status of Mexican workers in this country.
The proposal for a guest worker program, combined with a new legal status for some of the Mexicans already here without visas, would ''insure employers the availability of cheap labor,'' Dr.  Bustamante, director of the border studies program at El Colegio de Mexico, a respected research institute in Mexico City, said at a news conference here.
The Mexican Government has not officially commented on the Reagan proposals, which were announced last week. Dr. Bustamante, a sociologist who sometimes advises the Mexican Government, said that the Reagan Administration policy would perpetuate a ''subclass of workers'' and would establish a ''reserve army of labor that will be at the disposal of employers.''
The Administration proposed to admit 50,000 Mexicans a year as temporary workers in a two-year experimental program. Illegal aliens wishing to regularize their status could apply to become permanent residents after living here 10 years. In the waiting period, they would pay Social Security and income taxes but could not bring their spouses or young children and would not have access to welfare, food stamps or unemployment insurance.
Jorge Bustamante, Mexico's leading expert on immigration, criticizes new US immigration proposal as institutionalizing inferior status for MexicansPlan Is Defended
Attorney General William French Smith said today that he did not pay much heed to criticism of the Administration's program because it was all directed at individual elements and because the critics rarely offered a comprehensive alternative.
Mr. Smith said that the program was designed to deter illegal immigration while modestly expanding opportunities for legal employment of aliens in the United States.
However, Dr. Bustamante said: ''All parts of the program are conducive to an increase in the flow. The announcement of a guest worker program will increase expectations on the part of Mexican would-be migrants. These persons would come in larger numbers. This will increase competition and diminish wages.''
For more than 100 years, Dr. Bustamante said, ''Mexican labor has been defined and conceived by many employers as a natural resource of the Southwest.'' But ''Mexican labor is not cheap by nature,'' he said. ''It is made cheap by the laws of the United States and the practices of employers.''

'Safety Valve' Theory
The labor market in the Southwestern United States has often been described as a ''safety valve'' for the Mexican economy. But such a view, according to Dr. Bustamante, ignores the value of the foreign workers to businesses in this country.
''The United States needs the migrants as it needs energy,'' he said. ''But undocumented persons are not the same as barrels of oil.  They are human beings, they have rights.''
Dr. Bustamante said that ''employers of the Southwest would go into bankruptcy in less than a week'' if the border was closed and all undocumented workers were sent back to Mexico.
As an alternative, he recommended that ''organized labor in Mexico get together with organized labor in the United States to define the dimension of the real demand for migrant workers'' in this country.  Labor leaders, in turn, could negotiate wages and working conditions with groups of employers in various industries, he said.
Dr. Bustamante, who holds a Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame, spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a private, nonprofit group with a liberal political orientation.
He criticized the Administration's proposal to double the quota for legal immigration from Mexico on the ground that most of the additional visas would go to skilled and semiskilled workers of the very type most needed in Mexico.

Immigration1.0-34715,AIDES SAY THAT SEA PATROL HAS SLOWED HAITIAN ENTRIES,1981,12,new york times,"By GREGORY JAYNES, Special to the New York Times",section 1,940.0,"The Federal authorities say that the number of Haitian refugees headed for the United States has decreased dramatically in a year. They are crediting the Reagan Administration's decision to interdict these refugees at sea as well as widespread word in Haiti that coming to this country without proper documents means a loss of freedom.
Since the Government announced the interdiction policy in August, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has taken 1,960 Haitians into custody. In the same four months last year, the agency picked up 6,906. In all of 1980, the Government caught 15,093 Haitians, while in 1981, through Dec. 1, 8,023 had been detained. Last month only 47 were picked up as they reached Florida shores, as against 1,021 in November 1980.
Federal officials say number of Haitians seeking refuge in US has decreased dramatically this year
Though Coast Guard cutters patrolling the Windward Passage between Haiti and Cuba since September have interdicted only one boat, and that one sinking with 57 Haitians on board, a spokesman for the immigration service here said, ''That's where the word 'deterrent' comes in.''
The spokesman, Beverly McFarland, said that the presence of the Coast Guard off Haiti's coast, the Administration's ''detention posture'' and the attention the Haitian press paid the drownings of 33 refugees off a Florida beach Oct. 26 were three major reasons for the ''tremendous drop-off.'' She added that the Government's decision to establish Fort Drum, a 107,625-acre military installation near Watertown, N.Y., as a permanent detention facility for illegal aliens may have contributed.

The Fear of Siberia
Of Fort Drum, she said: ''A side effect may well be that there has been so much press about it being Siberia that it may have caused people to think twice. But it was not an intentional deterrent.''
A spokesman for the Haitian community in Miami discounted the Government's belief that the number of Haitians heading here had decreased. ''They're still coming,'' said the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, executive director of the Haitian Refugee Center Inc. ''They're just not caught. They drift in and I meet them every day myself.''
The Federal authorities concede that as many as 50,000 Haitians have eluded officials in the last 10 years and entered the United States illegally. Hundreds still do, the immigration agency believes, but the theory is that if 1,000 were apprehended in a month a year ago, with less manpower and less attention to the situation, then, given this year's resources and local awareness, if fewer than 50 are picked up in one month, it must mean fewer are coming.
''The Mariel boatlift threw everything into high relief,'' said Miss McFarland, referring to the 1980 Cuban refugees. ''There is no ignoring any boat that comes in with people who are illegal now.''

Most Living in Misery
There are about 2,500 Haitians in detention in Florida, Texas, Kentucky, West Virgina and New York. Some 700 others are at Fort Allen, P.R., under an agreement with the Puerto Ricans that the number will not exceed 800. By all accounts, the detainees are miserable.
Here in Miami, at the Krome Avenue camp on the eastern edge of the Everglades, there was a small riot Sept. 3. Two weeks ago, 45 men escaped over the 12-foot chain-link fence and the two-feet of barbed wire that tops it; 15 were recaptured. The night before Thanksgiving, 15 to 20 men shoved a guard against a wall and went over the fence; two were recaptured. In the next two nights, 21 fled.
The immigration agency added 12 Border Patrol guards to its 26-man security detail at Krome. There have been no breakouts in a week.  Immigration officials here say that Christmas may be a reason for tensions at Krome. The Haitians, nearly all of them Roman Catholics, have begun to realize they will be neither free nor home by the holiday, and to keep the place calm through this month the Government is allowing local clergymen to say mass and is negotiating with relief organizations for entertainment.
An ordinary day at Krome means standing around on the coral rock ground. There are no recreational facilities, nor at Fort Allen in Puerto Rico.
More than 100 Haitians have voluntarily left Fort Allen and been flown back to Haiti. Their places at Fort Allen have been filled by transfers of Haitians from Krome, which, at a population of 803 Friday, was filled to capacity.
Refugees at Fort Allen said today that they had found a 30-year-old father of five dead in his bunk, and they said they would refuse to let the authorities remove the body until they were allowed to see lawyers or the press, United Press International reported. The refugees said by telephone that they had found the body of Innocent Miclisse, a 30-year-old married man and the father of five.
The Government contends there would be no need for detention if a handful of lawyers had not taken more Haitian cases than they could handle and had not clogged the works with delaying tactics. The civil libertarians contend that the Haitians are political refugees, not solely economic refugees, as the Administration holds, and that their rights are being violated. There are a dozen unresolved suits in Federal courts in Miami. Another went to trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan Friday.
Next month, the Haitians are to be moved to Fort Drum, issued mittens and parkas, and taught to walk on ice and look for signs of frostbite. After that, Krome, a missile base thrown up in the 1962 Cuban crisis, is to be a processing facility, from which aliens will be shipped home or to Fort Drum.

Immigration1.0-35214,"ALIEN RAIDS OPENED UP JOBS, AIDE SAYS",1982,5,new york times,"By JO THOMAS, Special to the New York Times",section b,1050.0,"A series of raids by the Immigration and Naturalization Service rounded up 5,440 employed aliens and persuaded 4,071 of them to leave the country, according to Joseph Salgado, the agency's associate commissioner for enforcement.
The well-publicized ''Project Jobs,'' intended to force illegal aliens out of decent-paying jobs that could be held by unemployed citizens, produced a clamor of job-seekers in some places.
The immigration service gave state employment services and community groups the names of the businesses where aliens lacking the proper documents had been taken off the payroll. But how many of the jobs will be filled by citizens is unknown. The agency estimated that the jobs paid a total of $50.3 million a year.
WASHINGTON, May 6 - A series of raids by the Immigration and Naturalization Service rounded up 5,440 employed aliens and persuaded 4,071 of them to leave the country, according to Joseph Salgado, the agency's associate commissioner for enforcement.
The April raids came on the eve of detailed Congressional scrutiny of a bill, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1982, that today was considered line by line in a Senate subcommittee and sent to the full Judiciary Committee.

'Game Plan' Denied
Alan Nelson, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, said there was ''no game plan'' linking the arrests to the legislation. He said the raids were planned in February.
Nonetheless, questions raised about the raids, such as the degree to which illegal aliens contribute to unemployment among citizens and the degree to which employers are culpable, are part of the discussion of immigration reform. The bill under consideration in the Senate subcommittee would introduce penalties for those employing illegal aliens; the employers face no sanctions at present.
In an interview last week, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Associate Attorney General, said the raids took place in Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark, New York and San Francisco. Most of the aliens apprehended voluntarily agreed to leave the country; the others are facing deportation hearings.
The top-paying job involved, according to Mr. Salgado, paid $10.08 an hour at the Burlington Northern Railroad in Chicago. At an automobile parts concern in Chicago, he said, more than 30 undocumented workers were making $7 to $9 an hour. The average wages of those arrested nationwide was $4.81, Mr. Salgado said. In Chicago, more than 1,500 people applied for 161 vacated jobs.

Some May Reduce Workforce
A number of employers whose companies were raided, however, said that they might not hire any new workers right away. Some said the downturn in the economy would have forced layoffs in any case. Others said they still did not think they could find citizens who wanted to do the work. One said he could not rapidly train replacements.
At the Price Pfister Brass Manufacturing Company in Pacoima, Calif., where 80 workers were arrested, 1,000 applications were accepted, but the concern may not do any hiring.
''Of those who were taken,'' said Peter Gold, a company spokesman, ''50 have come back, and we are proceeding on the assumption that they have their documents and have been released. Ten have said they are involved in administrative hearings. Under the terms of our union contract, 20 people have been terminated for being missing for three full days. We don't know whether we're going to replace them. There is a recession. We've done no hiring for a year and a half.''
In New Jersey, where raids led to the arrest of 172 illegal aliens in 23 factories, Winifred Brady, the assistant director of the Division of Employment Services of the State Department of Labor, said six workers had been placed so far at $3.50 an hour.

Layoffs a Possibility
Walter Gibson, controller of the Carolyn Shoe Company in Monterey Park, Calif., said that the raids had caused layoffs at his company, where 80 of 240 workers were arrested.
''A line of production has to have every position filled,'' he said. ''You take out one third of the workers, and you have holes. On Monday, we laid off 30. Yesterday we laid off 10 more. We have ads in the papers for experienced help. But we have no manpower to train people off the street.''
He said that his company, because of foreign competition, paid only $5 to $6 an hour after long training.  Mr. Gibson said that although 40 of those arrested had returned to work, ''It'll be weeks before we can get the thing rolling. But we're not going to make poor shoes because of it.''
Another employer, Bruce Vaughan, part-owner of the Boulder Valley Poultry Farm, Boulder, Colo., said: ''We've had an ad in the paper for a long time, but usually people will not work in a poultry house. Half an hour later, they walk out. We don't pay less than $3.50 an hour, but they'd rather take welfare.''

Fleeing Worker Killed
Last Friday morning, a worker Mr. Vaughan knew as James Gonzalez, who had papers identifying him as Jose Morales, fled as immigration agents pulled up at the farm. In his panic, according to Mr. Vaughan, Mr. Morales ran to the main road and into the path of a gravel truck which struck and killed him.
The raids, in which 4,908, or 87 percent, of the 5,635 arrested were Mexican, have come under attack from Hispanic groups. The total of 5,635 included both employed aliens apprehended at job sites and others arrested at the sites.
''We're appalled at the raids,'' said Joaquin Avila, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ''This will seriously affect the rights of Hispanics when they seek employment.''
Arnaldo Torres, a spokesman for the League of United Latin American Citizens, said he felt that the raids would crystallize opposition to the immigration bill now before the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Policy. The bill, sponsored by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L.  Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky, contains penalties for employers who hire illegal aliens.
''Employer sanctions are a key part of the bill and have been since the beginning,'' Senator Simpson said. ''Now it's illegal for an illegal alien to work, but not for an employer to hire him.''

Five former guards at Fort Chaffee in Fort Smith (Ark) who have been accused of mistreating Cuban refugees will be retried in Federal courtA mistrial was declared on the remaining 14 charges after four days of jury deliberations.
United States Attorney Larry McCord of Fort Smith said that the retrial must be held before Dec. 11 to comply with a law that requires a retrial to begin within 70 days of the jury verdict.  Federal District Judge Oren Harris has not set a trial date.
Mr. McCord said the decision to retry the former guards was made by the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. The department contends that Cuban refugees being detained at Fort Chaffee pending release to sponsors were systematically and routinely assaulted by the immigration officers.

A lawsuit challenging the Federal policy of holding Haitian refugees in compounds while considering their status as immigrants is to come to trial Monday.Most of the refugees entered the country illegally.
The suit was filed by the Haitian Refugee Center Inc. on behalf of several Haitians held at the Krome Avenue Detention Center near here. More than 580 Haitians have been at the Krome center. Other detainees from Haiti are in compounds in New York, Arizona and Puerto Rico.
In a case last week, a Federal judge in New York ruled that the Government illegally detained eight Haitians at a Brooklyn center.  He termed discriminatory the refusal by the Government to parole the eight before their requests for political asylum were settled.
Meanwhile, 225 lawyers in Miami have indicated that they would volunteer to assist the Krome Haitians.

Immigration1.0-34987,AROUND THE NATION; Marcello Deportation Order Is Upheld by Appeals Court,1981,1,new york times,AP,section a,218.0,"A Federal appeals court today upheld an order to deport a reputed organized crime chief, Carlos Marcello of New Orleans, an effort that began almost 30 years ago.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by Federal District Judge Jack Gordon of New Orleans, who had blocked a deportation order upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals.
Federal Appeals Court upholds deportation order for organized crime leader,Carlos Marcello
''It means that Marcello's latest attempt to avoid deportation has been unsuccessful,'' said John Volz, a United States Attorney. ''The deportation order, arguably, is now back in effect.''
In refusing Mr. Marcello's 1972 application for suspension of the deportation order, the Board of Immigration Appeals said the reason was that he ''lacked good moral character.''
The board's refusal to suspend the deportation order was appealed to Judge Gordon in 1979. He vacated the board's ruling and sent the case back for a reassessment of Mr. Marcello's character.
Judge Gordon said he felt the board had relied on ''rumor and innuendo'' instead of reading more than 30 sworn affidavits obtained from Louisiana residents saying that Mr. Marcello is a fine man.
But the appeals court said, ''We are unable to adopt these objections to the board's order.''

According to Arthur J. Hutton, Mr. Flores's attorney, the conviction will be appealed on the ground that the trial should have been moved from Tucson because of extensive pretrial news coverage of incident, and because some jurors knew of the case before the trial began.
Prosecutors had charged that Mr. Flores helped the man they identified as the ringleader of the smuggling attempt, Carlos Rivera, to bring a group of 40 Salvadoran refugees across the Mexican border into the 516-acre Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona.

Immigration1.0-34727,BACKLOG GROWS ON ALIEN FILES,1981,11,new york times,UPI,section b,536.0,"Bureaucratic problems have left the Immigration and Naturalization Service unable to keep track of 30 million forms filed by foreign visitors, and it may be 1983 before it is known who entered or left the country in the last two years.
Disclosure of the backlog was made in a study conducted for the agency and by immigration officials in interviews.  The forms have not been processed so that they can be fed into the agency's computer system. Meanwhile, the millions of forms have simply been put on microfilm and left stacking up in cartons at agency facilities here.
Immigration and Naturalization Service is reportedly unable to keep track of 30 million forms filed by aliens due to paperwork backlog
Only a year ago, immigration officials told Congress that the agency would upgrade its computer system so it could monitor the flow of aliens into the country, including 10 million visitors a year. The Reagan Administration has also submitted proposals to Congress calling for stricter controls on illegal immigration.

A Threat to Credibility
Robert Kane, the agency's Associate Commissioner for operations support, said the backlog in processing visitor forms ''puts the whole credibility of the system into question - it puts the credibility of the I.N.S. into question.''
He said that the computer that stores visitors' data was ''outmoded.'' Irvin Klavan, the Associate Commissioner for information services, said the backlog of I-94 forms, which are filed when visitors enter and leave, totaled more than 30 million on Sept. 30, at the last official count. He said it was now probably 32 million.
He also said 664,000 visitors' applications for extensions of their temporary visas had not been put into the agency's computer because they could not be matched to the original arrival forms.

Long Wait Is Foreseen
Immigration officials say it will be at least January 1983 before the files are brought up to date.  Price Waterhouse & Company, a private consulting firm that conducted a six-month, $100,000 study of the control system, termed the backlog ''very troublesome.''
Agency officials blamed a private contractor, Milmark Services Inc. of Crofton, Md. They said Milmark failed to perform acceptably on a contract calling for it to enter the data into the computer system.
The task is complicated because the visitors' forms are often written in foreign languages.

Company Official Responds
Thomas Ruger, Milmark's treasurer, said in Wilmington, Del., that his company was being unfairly portrayed as a ''goat'' and that the backlog was 10 million forms before the company got the contract.
Mr. Ruger said the agency postponed the start of work under the contract six times while Milmark's previous owners frantically built up and reduced their staff in anticipation of the work. He said the company finally got only a week's notice, and ''you just don't put 100 people together in a week.'' Mr. Ruger said Milmark had been a successful Government contractor for 14 years and that the immigration episode threatened its future.

Immigration1.0-34839,BEFORE WE INVITE 'GUEST WORKERS',1981,8,new york times,,section a,156.0,"To the Editor:
Slashed Federal social programs will have a particularly severe im-pact on Puerto Rico. According to a news article published on July 25, we can expect a ''huge new wave of migration to the mainland'' as a result.
B A Rittersporn letter discusses Federal plan to relax immigration policies to allow Mexican ""guest workers""; cites need to help Puerto Rican peoplePuerto Rican officials assert that the only safeguard against ''possibly hundreds of thousands'' of immigrants would be to restore benefit programs.
Meantime, the Congress (Senators Hayakawa, Schmidt and others) and the Reagan Administration are proposing various ''guest worker'' programs. Many thousands of Mexicans and perhaps others would be imported to work in American factories and farms.
Is there a contradiction? If the workers are genuinely needed - unemployment rates notwithstanding - and the American taxpayer is required to smooth the way for the newcomers, shouldn't we opt to help our fellow nationals from Puerto Rico ''to relocate''?

Immigration1.0-34816,CALIFORNIA BECOMES MELTING POT OF 1980'S,1981,8,new york times,"By ROBERT LINDSEY, Special to the New York Times",section 1,1742.0,"Over the last decade, California has all but supplanted New York as the principal ethnic melting pot of America, according to data from the 1980 census.
In a tide of immigration that is reshaping the social, economic and political life of the nation's most populous state, California has become the port of entry for tens of thousands of refugees from economic and political troubles abroad.
''California,'' says Dr. Bertram Brown, a psychiatrist and population researcher for the Rand Corporation, ''has become the Ellis Island of the 1980's.''
As New York's Ellis Island was the gateway for the great trans-Atlantic tide of immigration 80 years ago, California's proximity to Latin America and the Pacific has made it the gateway for the immigrants of the 1980's.

European Immigration Recalled
According to demographers, not since the turn of the century, when millions of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe flocked to America and settled in New York and other cities along the East Coast, have so many alien immigrants from so many countries gravitated to a single region of the country.
Effect of tide of immigration to California on state's population is discussed
There are refugees from Southeast Asia, Cuba, Ethiopia and the Soviet Union, as well as Taiwanese, Samoans, Koreans, Cubans and uncounted legal and illegal aliens from Latin America and elsewhere, all shouting, figuratively, ''California or bust,'' as the immigrants from ''back East'' did a hundred years ago.
Because much of the immigration is illegal, no one knows how many newcomers are arriving here from abroad. Based on data from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, however, the legal migration to California from abroad last year is believed to have ranged from 150,000 to 200,000, including about 50,000 Southeast Asians. The state's total population growth was about 450,000.

Decline in White Proportion
Pat Johnson, a Census Bureau analyst, says that one of the most significant elements measured by the 1980 census regarding California's population was the emergence of its polyglot character.
From 1970 to 1980, according to the bureau's figures, the proportion of California residents who are ''Anglos,'' that is, those whose ethnic roots are predominately in Western Europe, declined to 76 percent from 89 percent. The proportion of virtually every other ethnic category increased substantially.
Asians and Pacific Islanders, for example, formed the category that grew most rapidly, increasing 140 percent, to 1.25 million. The number of Californians with Hispanic roots, the fastest-growing category in terms of total numbers, increased 92 percent, to 4.5 million. The state's overall population increased 18.5 percent, to 23.7 million, in the 1970's.
In the same decade California recorded a 30 percent increase in blacks, to 1.8 million, and a 118 percent increase in American Indians, bringing the total to 198,000, more than any other state.

Diverse Cultural Textures
The new wave of immigrants to California is adding diverse cultural textures to the fabric of life here, providing labor for many industries, affecting and sometimes overloading social services and public schools, and adding a new, if uncertain, dimension to the state's political life.
Elected officials have been wondering for years when Hispanic Americans, who now make up 19 percent of California's population, would be able to transfer this strength to the ballot box. So far, the state's few Hispanic leaders have not been very successful in broadening their influence, but politicians here say they expect them to have at least limited success in current negotiatons over Congressional redistricting efforts as a result of the census.
The immigration has had a variety of effects on life in California. In places like Beverly Hills and Marin County, north of San Francisco, money brought by immigrants from Korea and Hong Kong has been cited as one reason for California's hyperinflated real estate market over the last six years.
In other areas, those that attract the far larger proportion of immigrants who come without much money, officials say that tensions are rising between different ethnic groups because of competition for jobs and housing.

Tensions Likely to Increase
Some officials expect the tensions between people at the lowest rung of the economic ladder to increase as the size of the minority population grows.
''It's like a keg of dynamite with a one-inch fuse,'' said Fred Koch, a deputy superintendent of schools in Los Angeles County, who sees tensions mounting, especially among blacks, Hispanic Americans and Indochinese refugees.
Many of the new immigrants, like their predecessors of 80 years ago, have settled in California's big cities, and they are creating distinctive ethnic neighborhoods.
Whole areas of San Francisco look as if they had been transferred from Southeast Asia. Here in Los Angeles, a city long noted for its freeway-oriented blandness, local schools now teach students with more than 70 different native tongues. The city's increased cosmopolitanism has brought an appealing diversity in restaurants and neighborhoods that are reminiscent of New York.
Much of downtown Los Angeles is now the principal shopping district of its large population of Mexican immigrants. Along Olympic Boulevard are dozens of shops and restaurants that cater to a population of Koreans estimated at more than 100,000.

Influx of Indochinese
In the suburb of Monterey Park more than one-third of its residents are Chinese. More than 10,000 Samoans live in and near the suburb of Carson.
Near San Diego, the semi-rural suburb of Linda Vista has seen its population increase by almost 50 percent since 1975 because of an influx of more than 7,000 Indochinese refugees.
In Orange County south of here, officials estimate that there are more than 50,000 Indochinese. Some local residents have dubbed the community of Westminister ''Little Saigon;'' about 6,000 of its 71,000 people are Vietnamese.
Lois Wax, the Orange County refugee coordinator, said the county's public schools had nearly 10,000 Indochinese children, ''many of whom speak little or no English.''

America's 'Third-World State'
Representative Mervyn M. Dymally said three years ago, when he was California's Lieutenant Governor, that the state was on its way to becoming the nation's first ''third-world state,'' in which a majority of the population would be members of American racial minority groups.
His prediction has not been fulfilled yet, but population trends are moving in that direction.  To a large extent, what is happening in California mirrors a national trend. The 1980 census showed that in the 1970's the proportion of Americans classified as belonging to racial minorities - essentially, blacks, Hispanic Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders and American Indians - increased to 16.8 percent of the population from 12.5 percent.
In California, the census showed that Asians accounted for 5.3 percent of the total population. The proportion has undoubtedly grown this year, says Dorothy Hoag, a state demographer, because of the continuing influx of Indochinese refugees, who now total almost 200,000.
From 3,000 to 4,000 Indochinese refugees are still being resettled in California each month, she said, and at least 1,000 a month are moving here on their own after being resettled in other states.

Rise in Hispanic Population
In terms of net population growth, the number of Hispanic Americans is increasing even faster; the 1980 census found that they comprised 19.2 percent of the total population, or about 4.5 million, and blacks comprised almost 8 percent of the total, about 1.8 million.
Statistical trends seem to indicate that these patterns will continue and may accelerate, demographers say.  As a group, they say, ethnic minorities have a significantly higher birth rate than the Anglo population; thus, their proportion of the population is likely to grow at a faster rate than that of whites.
In 1979, the last year for which figures are available, members of minority groups made up 40 percent of the students enrolled in the state's public schools, up from 36.5 percent two years earlier.
Isabel Hambright, a demographer for the State Department of Finance, predicts that the percentage of minority students will continue to increase. The proportion of minority children in the population, she said, ''is like a very broad pyramid,'' with the youngest at the bottom. While Hispanic Americans make up 19 percent of the state's population, she said, they account for 25 to 30 percent of children under the age of 5.

Larger Share of Immigrants
Besides the natural growth in population, researchers say California is likely to continue getting more than its share of immigrants; last year the state, with about 10 percent of the nation's population, accepted at least 20 percent of the total legal immigration.
Some were Europeans and Canadians. But they were dwarfed statistically by the much larger tide of immigrants from Latin America and Asia. Indeed, there were more permanent legal aliens living in California last year from one Asian country alone, the Philippines, than from all of the nations of Europe.
Dr. Brown, the Rand researcher, said, ''It's like Brighton Beach or Coney Island in the 20's and 30's,'' a melting pot with a diverse texture of peoples from different countries and speaking different languages. But in California, he added, ''they're not European.''
However, Doyce Nunis, a professor of history at the University of Southern California, said that so far the state's new immigrants are ''more ghettoized'' than ''melted together.''
About 85 languages are now spoken in California, he said. ''What do you do when there are Vietnamese who don't read or write even their own language? There's no way to melt them together.''

Immigration1.0-34876,CROAT ACCUSED OF WAR CRIMES IS ORDERED DEPORTED,1981,7,new york times,"By CHARLES MOHR, Special to the New York Times",section a,659.0,"A Department of Justice official said today that the Government would move quickly to deport a person who as Interior Minister of the Nazi German puppet state of Croatia in World War II purportedly ordered the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.
An order of the Board of Immigration Appeals overturned a stay of deportation granted to the former Croatian official, Andrija Artukovic, in 1959 on the ground that he would be subject to ''political persecution'' if returned to Yugoslavia. Mr. Artukovic, 8l years old, lives in southern California and has successfully resisted deportation and extradition for 30 years.
Allan A. Ryan, Jr., the director of the Office of Special Investigations of the Justice Department, said that the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in a letter delivered today, had directed Mr. Artukovic to report to its regional office in Los Angeles by next Wednesday to be handed a deportation order.
He could legally be deported within 72 hours of his appearance at the regional office, but he may file a petition requesting a review of the order by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, which includes California. Such a petition would automatically stay the deportation order.
US Government plans to deport Andrija Artukovic for war crimes committed in Croatia during World War II
Mr. Ryan expressed the opinion that Mr. Artukovic would have ''only very narrow legal grounds'' for an appeal. A 1953 decision by the immigration board determined that Mr. Artukovic ''was a leading Nazi criminal during the Second World War'' and a 1978 law says that Nazi war criminals cannot claim deportation stays on the ground that they would be subject to persecution.
A spokesman for the Yugoslav Embassy said today his Government regarded Mr. Artukovic as a ''war criminal'' and he would be tried if deported.
Justice Department officials said the action in the Artukovic case had nothing to do with the indictment last month of a group of eight Croatian nationalists. Mr. Artukovic, who came to the United States in 1948 under a false name and with an Irish passport, was a leading figure in the Ustashi movement, which has long been struggling for the independence of Croatia from Yugoslavia.
When Hitler dismembered Yugoslavia in 1941, Ante Pavelic, the Ustashi leader, formed a Croatian state under German tutelage and made Mr. Artukovic the Interior Minister.
Croatia proclaimed a policy of persecution against various ethnic groups, mainly Serbs, Jews and Gypsies. Journalistic and historical accounts say that more than 300,000 people, including 30,000 Jews, were executed.
The 1953 decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals, which was in effect affirmed today, said: ''There appears to be little doubt that the new Croatian state, at least on paper, pursued a genocidal policy in Croatia with regard to Jews and Serbs; that Artukovic helped execute this policy in that, as Minister of Interior, he had authority and control over the entire system of public security and internal administration.''
A witness at the 1961 trial in Israel of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi who oversaw the German effort to exterminate European Jews, testified that Mr. Artukovic was ''recognized by the Nazis as a leader in the anti-Jewish pogroms.''
Mr. Pavelic and Mr. Artukovic vanished when the Croatian state collapsed at the end of World War II in 1945. Mr. Pavelic reached Argentina, where he was wounded in an apparent assassination attempt in 1957. He disappeared again when Argentina agreed later that year to consider a Yugoslav extradition request and he was reported to have gone to Paraguay. Subsequently he moved to Madrid, where he died in December 1959 at the age of 70.
Mr. Artukovic worked, until retirement, as a bookkeeper and resides in Surfside, Calif., south of Long Beach.

Immigration1.0-34307,DO ALIENS FILL NEED OR CROWD JOD FIELD; DALLAS,1980,10,new york times,By PETER APPLEBOME,section 12,1133.0,"WHEN 29-year old Dock Green lost his job on the management-training squad at a fried-chicken franchise here, the first telephone call he made was to the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service.
''I realized I was in trouble right from the start when I saw that I was the only one there who spoke English. Everyone else spoke only Spanish,'' Mr. Green said. ''I kept complaining to my boss that all these people were illegal aliens, and he didn't want to do anything about it.
Illegal aliens have visible role in current conditons in U S job market
''I have nothing against those people, but every day we had people coming in asking about jobs, and it's a pitiful shame to have people who are born and raised here be out of work, and have these illegal aliens taking their job. To me, the law means what it says, and if those people are illegal, then the law should be obeyed.''
Mr. Green is not alone in his frustration. Illegal aliens are playing an increasingly visible role in the job market, a role subjected to rising criticism at a time of relatively high unemployment of Americans.
But Hispanic leaders and many academics insist the impact of those workers is essentially benign. They say Mexican workers who cross the 1,300-mile border into the United States do the menial jobs Americans don't want, are essential for the harvesting of crops, and use very few municipal services while filling the lowest niches in the job market.
Ruben Bonilla, president of the 100,000-member League of United Latin-American Citizens, said undocumented workers, in addition to playing a positive role in the economy, actually increase tax revenues by paying for Social Security service they seldom use. He said any crackdown on Mexican immigration would have a much more harmful effect than any displacement of Americans from available jobs that goes on now.
''If we close the border, I feel that Mexico would literally burst at the seams,'' he said. ''When you look at Mexico's 30 percent inflation and crippling unemployment, it's clear these people have nowhere else to go. If they couldn't leave, I think social conditions in Mexico could become so bad there would be the loss of the democratic republic in Mexico as we know it. I don't think America would want a Socialist or Communistic nation any closer than Cuba.''
Most experts would agree with Mr. Bonilla that Mexicans and other aliens fill manual tasks that are the least desirable in the job market. But many of those same experts also would agree with Mr.  Green that there is no shortage of Americans competing for many of those jobs.
Proposals to deal with the flood of illegal aliens in the job market have ranged from tighter border patrols, to sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens, to temporary work visas that would allow a limited number of aliens to work here legally. Even those calling for one policy or another concede there is no way to be sure how many illegal aliens are in the work force or what their effects have been.
''I don't have any hard data and I don't know anyone who does,'' said Dr. Vernon Briggs, a labor economist at Cornell University, who has studied illegal immigration since the mid-1960's. ''But it can't be in the best interests of this country to have a whole population of people who are without rights, people who can't vote, people who have to live in constant fear of detection. It's becoming a problem we can't ignore any longer even if we wanted to.''
Estimates on the number of illegal aliens vary from 6 million to 12 million, but despite the lack of hard figures, some trends are clear. The vast majority live and work in three states, California, Texas and Florida, and two cities, New York and Chicago. Most of them come here for one reason: to work.
Most illegal aliens work in agriculture, restaurants, or hotels.  Mexico, which sends an estimated 500,000 illegal aliens into this country every year, is the biggest source. Other aliens come from Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Hong Kong, the Philippines and dozens of other nations, but experts estimate 60 percent of illegal aliens in the country are Mexican.
Dr. Briggs, who became interested in illegal aliens after trying to help organize farm workers in south Texas in the 1960's, said his research shows illegal aliens compete with Americans for jobs in all industries in which they are represented, at the same time depressing wages and blunting moves toward unionization or improvement of working conditions.
''The studies that have been done show the employment patterns of illegal aliens in the Southwest are very similar to those of other Chicanos in terms of geography and occupation. We've built this whole phantom labor source into the labor market and someone must show what they do if not compete with the available labor force.''
One matter that is not in question is the conditions under which illegal aliens live. Francisco Barba, a San Francisco lawyer who has defended hundreds of illegal aliens, told the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, a group created almost two years ago to study immigration policies, that ''immigration labor today is America's neo-slavery institution.'' Federal investigators in recent years have documented hundreds of cases of abuse of illegal aliens. A Federal Department of Labor strike force investigating treatment of illegal aliens in Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth this year uncovered $1.2 million in underpayments owed 4,470 employees, most of them illegal Mexican aliens. Officials said the investigation involved only a tiny percentage of illegal aliens in the area.
In 1977, President Carter asked Congress to pass legislation allowing the Government to fine employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. The legislation, and others like it, was rejected, but another bill calling for employer sanctions is pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee and may be considered by the entire Senate later this year.
Supporters say sanctions are the most effective way to keep aliens out of the labor market. Some opponents say sanctions would make employers do the job of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Others say aliens are essential in some industries -primarily farm work - where there is not an adequate supply of Americans who will do the work. And Hispanic leaders say sanctions would prompt employers to discriminate against all Hispanics.

Immigration1.0-34752,Essay; LAST GASP OF THE 1960'S,1981,10,new york times,By William Safire,section 4,906.0,"Crime buffs up North are thrilled and horrified by the running gun battles of political terrorists, the early investigations of whom caused the decade-long harassment of F.B.I.  officials. Times have changed: the lawmen are once again the good guys, and we give as much encouragement to enforcing the law as to upholding the law. It took until the early 1980's to bring the 1960's to an end.
Crime buffs down South have an even gorier story, of a ''voodoo death boat,'' to tell: Two Haitian boat captains, illegally running immigrants into the U.S., have been accused of carving up perhaps 16 of their starving passengers with machetes and throwing the bodies overboard. Because the alleged crimes took place outside the 12-mile limit of the United States, prosecutors have merely been able to charge ''smuggling that involved the use of murder and privation,'' which is not a capital crime.
William Safire op-ed comment contrasts recent acts by Weather Underground and other terrorist groups with immigration ""crimes"" by Haitian refugees
You don't have to be a crime buff, however, or be caught in a running gun battle or a death ship, to be touched by crime. It is not the televised crime that frightens most people, it is the single, not-very-newsworthy weapon pointed at them that counts. Here in Miami, one person in ten was victimized by criminals last year.
''Miami Beach has gone from being the fun and sun capital of the world,'' says a local politician, ''to the slum and bum capital.'' Seven out of the ten worst urban crime rates in the nation are in Florida, from Miami to Gainesville to Tallahassee.
Police officials explain that their crime figures are inflated because of visitors, but they cannot deny the alarming increase over past years with the same percentage of tourists. The breakdown in law enforcement was best shown by Gregory Jaynes, a New York Times reporter, in a single figure: gun dealers reported sales up 46 percent from the year before. These are not guns for criminals; in the main, these are guns bought by frightened citizens who feel the need to protect themselves.
Chamber of Commerce types are torn between the desire to downplay the crime wave, lest it damage tourism, and the urge to holler for help to protect small businesses from holdups. Tourists are understandably nervous, even though this season's more conservative swimsuit fashions offer more room to pack a rod.
What is causing the shadow of crime to fall across the Sunshine State? A local narcotics war is drilling some holes in some heads, but that's normal. Some blame the sharp increase in violent crime on the emptying of Fidel Castro's jails upon the population of Florida, and suggest this goes hand in hand with Cuban support of Weathermen terrorists in a campaign to harm the United States.
The Senate Intelligence Committee should investigate why that campaign has been so poorly investigated by the F.B.I. and C.I.A.  For more than a decade, the emphasis has been on the protection of the privacy rights of the accused; now we should have ways of probing terrorist activities without undermining the Constitution.  Using grand juries and search warrants, lawmen should be proceeding to break up terrorist rings and track down any overseas connections without undue fear of being prosecuted or sued themselves.
Another reason given for the crime wave in Florida is the influx of Haitians, fleeing from hunger and overcrowding at home. The Federal Government is now stopping the illegal traffic on the high seas, to the cluck-clucking of far-off media. We should go further and tie aid to Haiti to its cooperation with a voluntary blockade of its coast, thereby curtailing the need for odious detention centers here and stopping terror aboard the ''death ships.'' The peoplesmuggling will stop when it becomes clear that illegal immigrants will be towed home and the boat owners, captains and crews jailed in Haiti.
But immigration cannot be the primary cause of a crime wave; more often, the immigrants are the scapegoats. The Federal Government should pay for policing the nation's borders, and for boarding or detaining those for whom exceptions in immigration policy are made.  The citizens of Florida can then look to their state and local officials, who would have no place to pass the buck for inadequate law enforcement. Epidemics require emergency measures; the best quick answer is more local police and tougher juries and jurists, which must come from aroused local citizens and not from Washington.
In the spectacular crimes North and South, there is an interesting contrast in motives.  The romanticized revolutionaries, often from well-to-do homes, see themselves as the subject of future Bonnie and Clyde movies, and have pledged their lives, fortunes and sacred dishonor to the hatred of American values; they probably intended to symbolize their defiance by the murder of lawmen. The hungry immigrants who braved the savagery of sadistic captains were breaking our immigration laws to taste the freedom and opportunity that only this country offers.
Why is it that nobody commits the crime of breaking into Cuba or the Soviet Union? Because what the Weather Underground seeks to destroy, the world's underclass pleads for the chance to share.

Immigration1.0-34784,EX-FEDERAL AIDE GETS FOUR YEARS IN ABSCAM CASE,1981,9,new york times,By JOSEPH P. FRIED,section b,422.0,"A former Federal immigration investigator from Long Island was sentenced to four years in prison yesterday for his bribery conviction stemming from the Government's Abscam inquiry into official corruption.
The term was imposed on 32-year-old Alexander A. Alexandro Jr. of Commack, after a Justice Department prosecutor contended in Federal District Court in Brooklyn that Mr. Alexandro knew of ''corrupt acts'' by other employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The prosecutor, John H. Jacobs, implied to Judge Mark A.  Costantino, that the prospect of a ''stiff sentence'' might induce Mr. Alexandro to tell the authorities what he knew in the hope that his sentence would be lightened.
Alexander Alexandro Jr, former Federal immigration investigator, is sentenced to 4 years in prison for bribery stemming from Abscam inquiry
Outside the courtroom, Mr. Jacobs confirmed that prosecutors wanted to bring Mr. Alexandro before a grand jury and question him further about state me nts he had made to Federal undercover agents indicating corrupt behav ior by others in the immigration agency.
Mr. Alexandro's 1979 meetings with the undercover men - from whom he took a $2,000 payoff in an immigration deal - were surreptitiously videotaped.

Calls Term 'Pretty Harsh'
Mr. Alexandro later called the term ''pretty harsh.'' His lawyer, Joel Winograd, termed it ''coercive.'' Mr. Alexandro faced up to 15 years. He remained free pending the outcome of his appeal.
Mr. Jacobs reaffirmed earlier statements that the Government wanted to bring before a grand jury a Long Island businessman convicted of conspiring with Mr. Alexandro. Mr. Jacobs said that prosecutors wanted to investigate statements that the businessman, Alfred Carpentier, had made to the Abscam agents about what was said to have been corruption or potential corruption involving political figures whom Mr. Jacobs declined to name.
The sentencing of Mr. Carpentier, a 56-year-old East Meadow man, was postponed until Oct. 13. Mr. Jacobs said the Justice Department might ask that a hearing scheduled in connection with the sentencing be closed to the public because of the ''nature of the allegations'' that Mr. Carpentier had made.
Mr. Carpentier's lawyer, James A. Pascarella, said his client had simply been name-dropping in discussing the political figures with the undercover men.
Mr. Carpentier faces up to five years for his conviction in the immigration case.

Immigration1.0-34372,EXCERPTS FROM MURPHY'S DENIAL,1980,6,new york times,,section b,684.0,"Following are excerpts from a statement issued yesterday by Representative John M. Murphy about charges pending against him:
Following are excerpts from a statement issued yesterday by Representative John M. Murphy about charges pending against him: The first major charge is that I allegedly accepted a portion of a $50,000 bribe for providing a phony Arab sheik with immigration help. The allegation is supposedly supported by the videotape taken of myself, Mr. Criden an F.B.I. undercover agent and an informer working for the F.B.I. in a Kennedy Airport motel room on Oct. 20, 1979.
The truth of the matter is I never promised to help in such immigration matters nor did I introduce and get passed any such legislation.
The videotape of the Kennedy Airport meeting were reviewed by my lawyer, Michael Tigar and myself on two occasions and they show the following:
At no time was the prospect of legislation even discussed by me.  The agent and the informer asked for some assistance in getting someone into the country and I told them to get a lawyer, that all they had to do was file the proper immigration forms if they had a problem.
AN-A
I in fact advised against an attempt to get the phony sheik into the United States in view of this Administration's treatment of high ranking foreign leaders who sought sanctuary here.
Howard Criden carried a briefcase out of that meeting. I was never shown or told the contents of the briefcase and I subsequently did not receive any portion of whatever was supposed to be in that briefcase. There was no explanation at all of the contents of the briefcase.
When these tapes are made public it will be seen and it will be made very clear that the references from the time that briefcase appeared until all of the parties who were talking go off camera, that the briefcase only had to do with Mr. Criden and nothing to do with Murphy.
There was no discussion in that meeting of any money being in the briefcase. The discussion about it was simply that it was a briefcase that Mr. Criden was to take with him.
That was not a discussion in which I had any role. Howard Criden took it downstairs, got in a separate automobile and left. That has been my public position and that is what the tapes will reveal. I have so testified under oath.
The second major charge in the indictment is that Congressman Thompson and I both conspired to have the sheik invest large amounts of money in business deals that would ''inure directly and indirectly'' to our benefit.
Specifically I was supposed to somehow be financially involved with Mr. Lawrence Buser, the former president of American Export Lines who discussed with the bogus Arab representatives the possible purchase of a Puerto Rican shipping line.
The truth of the matter is contained in the videotape recorded meeting on the 10th of January, 1980 at the W Street townhouse at which I was present and Mr. Criden, Mr. Buser, Mr. Weinberg and agent Amoroso or Devito as he called himself, were present.
At that meeting the tapes show that I stated in no uncertain terms in response to leading, suggestive questions by Agent Amoroso that not only would I not participate in any business deal of the kind that was being discussed and that I would not accept any favors or consideration of any kind in return for any official action on my part but that I, in no uncertain terms, said it was wrong for the suggestion even to be made.
The tapes further show the F.B.I. agents repeatedly attempted to get me to say that I would be involved in a shipping enterprise. I once said unequivocally ''I am not in this'' and when Mr. Weinberg persistently tried to enveigle my name into the conversation Mr.  Buser said on several occasions ''he is not involved in this.'' Seeing they had thus failed to involve me, Agent Amoroso asked me into the library to try to get me to say something that would be incriminating. I was annoyed at what - I now find - was a pathetic display of amateur seduction and I actually lectured Amoroso on the ethics of what it means to hold and responsibly discharge a public trust.

Immigration1.0-35292,EXILED SOUTH AFRICAN ALLOWED TO SEEK ASYLUM,1982,1,new york times,Special to the New York Times,section a,396.0,"Dennis Brutus, the exiled South African poet and scholar who has been ruled ''deportable'' because of an expired visa, received a temporary reprieve today.
A United States immigration judge, Irving Schwartz, gave him 20 days to seek political asylum in this country. The petition will be submitted to the State Department for advice, a process that generally takes at least 30 days.
Dennis Brutus, exiled South African poet, is permitted to seek political asylum in US
When the State Department advisory opinion is returned to Judge Schwartz, a hearing will take up whether Professor Brutus will be granted asylum, have his visa extended, leave the country voluntarily or be deported. In addition, according to Robert Vinikoor, a lawyer for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, ''It should be stated on record where Brutus should be sent,'' in the event of deportation.
Professor Brutus's attorney, H. Nasif Mahmoud, had asked that his home be defined by the court as South Africa. But, Mr. Vinikoor said, ''We do not intend to designate South Africa, but rather Zimbabwe, the country of his birth, from which he holds a passport.''
Mr. Mahmoud asserted that his client's life would be in danger in Zimbabwe. He said that terrorists employed by South Africa are at work there; he cited the murder of a South African nationalist, Joe Gqabi, in July 1981.
In the meantime, Mr. Brutus, a senior professor of African literature in the Northwestern University English department, is free to return to Amherst College, where he is spending a sabbatical year as a visiting writer.
In the 20-minute hearing, much time was spent in argument on the professor's sojurn at Amherst while claiming residency at Northwestern. Judge Schwartz repeatedly demanded to know why no mention of the sabbatical had been made at a hearing in November.
In tones of exasperation, the judge read from the November transcript. But his expression changed as Mr. Mahmoud said that a passage marked ''unintelligible'' referred to Amherst College. The Judge smiled, and said, ''I take it back.''
Mr. Mahmoud called the hearing ''a victory in that Dennis didn't get thrown out, but it's a short-lived victory be-

Immigration1.0-34920,FLAWED OPPOSITION TO A FOREIGN-WORKER PLAN,1981,5,new york times,,section a,663.0,"To the Editor:
Your May 11 news story ''Plan Would Let Mexicans Work as U.S.  Guests'' tried for balanced treatment of the White House proposal for a temporary foreign worker (T.F.W.) program by citing some opinions from outside the Administration. Unfortunately, those opinions, which were almost all in opposition to such a program, were neither well-informed nor fully representative.
o begin with, the ''bracero'' program, which operated from 1942 to 1964, was far from having ''stimulated illegal immigration.'' Official records show that illegal entrants fell well below 100,000 a year from 1956 to 1964 but after the end of the bracero program rose continuously, to reach over one million by 1977.
City College Professor Edwin P Reubens letter responds to May 11 article on temporary foreign worker program to accommodate Mexican labor
It is true that many braceros were abused, and sometimes cheated, by their farm employers, and that they were not adequately defended by Federal and local authorities. Yet they kept coming because their earnings far outran the jobs and pay rates available in Mexico. As for the alleged adverse effect on the wages and working conditions of American agricultural workers, the records of the U.S. Department of Agriculture show a markedly rising trend of their wages right through the bracero period and beyond.
The interpretation of the Western European experience, as cited in your dispatch, is similarly incomplete. It is true that when recession set in after 1973 repatriation was slow - but it was not zero. Furthermore, it was largely the presence of wives, children and other dependents that intensified the reluctance to leave.
However, a U.S. program for temporary workers only, excluding their dependents, should induce homeward flows. Conversely, the European programs entailed few complaints about abuse of guest workers, except for poor housing and cultural isolation in some countries. Our own small H-2 visa program works with few abuses or overstays.
The assertion that temporary foreign workers in the U.S. would become a ''sub-class'' and ''subject to exploitation'' ignores the realities of both the present illegal aliens and the alternatives they have left in their homelands.
Exploitation in fact takes advantage of the undocumented status and furtive life of illegals here; legal foreign worker status would rescue them from abuse. Furthermore, the foreign workers do not see ''exploitation'' in wages that are at the U.S. legal minimum, or even illegally below it, when their earnings generally amount to as much in an hour here as in a whole day back home - if they could only find a job there.
The most confused opposition to a temporary foreign worker program is the assertion that ''it makes no sense to bring additional workers to the U.S. when there are 8 million unemployed already.'' This argument ignores the structural segmentation of the U.S. labor market. In particular, the low-level jobs - low in skills, in pay, in status, in interest and in working conditions but mostly urban jobs nowadays, rather than farming - are hard to fill with Americans.  U.S. workers are variously able to withhold their labor from such work, and in effect are leaving vacancies which foreign workers fill.
This adjustment in the labor market does not undermine prevailing labor standards or American employment - although it may prevent wage increases and might therefore be said to help fight inflation and imports.
A temporary foreign worker program carefully designed to meet the indicated realities deserves a judicious hearing in this country.  EDWIN P. REUBENS Professor of Economics The City College New York, May 13, 1981

Immigration1.0-34872,FLORIDA TO SUE U.S. IN REFUGEE DISPUTE,1981,7,new york times,Special to the New York Times,section 1,559.0,"Florida is preparing a lawsuit against the Federal Government over its handling of Haitian and Cuban refugees in the Miami area, Gov. Bob Graham announced here today.
Mr. Graham said that the state had retained a Washington law firm and had instructed it ''to file the lawsuit as soon as possible.'' While Mr. Graham has not disclosed details of a possible legal basis for his action, he indicated at a news conference that it would concentrate on the handling of Haitians who arrive in south Florida by boat illegally almost every day.
Florida'a Governor Bob Graham announces plan to sue Federal Government over Haitian and Cuban refugee dispute
In a typical case, Haitians who come here by boat are detained by the local authorities and are handed over to officers of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, who take them to Krome North Detention Center in Miami. There are reports that a number of Haitians evade arrest and detention.
According to Mr. Graham, by placing about 1,500 Haitians at Krome North, the Federal Government has violated laws under which the camp can hold only about 500 persons. The number at the center yesterday was 1,483, and a new boatload was reported today.

'Dumping' Without Sponsors
Another violation of state laws, Mr. Graham said, was the release from the detention center of Haitians who did not have sponsors, ''in effect dumping them on the citizens of Greater Miami.''
Mr. Graham, a Democrat, said that his action against the Reagan Administration was not politically motivated. ''We have been demanding solutions to the refugee problem for more than a year and all we have have had have been glaring examples of broken promises by Washington,'' he said.
The Governor also said that the state had paid over $30 million in medical and other expenses for some 15,000 Cuban refugee children who came here by sea last year. He said the payments had been made ''without Washingon recognizing that this is a national problem and not that of this area or of the State of Florida.''
''The people of Florida cannot be asked to bear this onerous burden while Federal officials continue to postpone difficult decisions,'' he continued.  ''If the national Administration will not act on its own we will take legal recourse to protect the rights of the citizens.''

Immigration Report Awaited
Last March, President Reagan appointed a panel to review United States immigration laws and to recommend changes, especially regarding policy toward illegal immigrants. According to White House officials, the panel's recommendations might be made public next week.
In Florida, above all in the Miami area, illegal migration has become one of the most acute social and political problems. While no more new Cuban refugees have been arriving since last October, there has been no letup in the arrival of Haitians.
Under the current regulations, most of the undocumented Cubans and Haitians are subject to exclusion proceedings and can be deported to the country of origin. But last month a Federal judge in Miami halted exclusion proceedings of undocumented Haitians and ordered the Immigration and Naturalization Service to hear their cases individually rather than in groups and to allow them access to attorneys and competent translators.

Immigration1.0-34707,FOR A CARIBBEAN COMPACT,1981,12,new york times,By Robert Pastor,section a,852.0,"The Reagan Administration has admirably tried to address the two difficult issues of immigration and development in the Caribbean Basin - all the countries in and around the Caribbean Sea.
These two initiatives generously leave Congress substantial room to improve them, but the most serious flaw with these proposals is that they do not address the relationship between the two problems.
To address them separately is shortsighted and could very well aggravate both problems.  An effective policy that curbed migration would necessarily generate uncontainable social and political tensions in the region.  Economic development, which relies primarily on foreign investment and fails to address the migration problem, could stimulate more illegal migration.
Robert Pastor op-ed article proposes comprehensive US policy on Caribbean Basin area states
Moreover, the countries of the region will not with us in regulating the flow of people without some compensatory policy, since that will probably mean they have to support an overwhelmingly unskilled population while the United States absorbs more of their skilled workers.
Since President Reagan will not completely unveil his Caribbean Basin initiative until January, there is still time to correct this oversight and to fashion a proposal that relates the two problems.
To use the Administration's own phrase, it ought to ''go to the source,'' and propose a Caribbean Basin Compact, in which the United States and other donors in the region or interested in it would double aid, expand private investment, and guarantee access to their markets for textiles and other competitive products.
The recipient countries, in turn, would agree to use their increased aid for labor-intensive investments in agriculture and light manufacturing in regions where emigration has been greatest.
All nations would formulate and agree to a Caribbean-wide development plan for restructuring and relocating the region's manufacturing and agriculture during the next 10 years.
The United States would accept more legal immigrants from the Caribbean Basin and gradually curtail both the illegal flow and the ''brain drain.'' Returning migrants would be given credits from a special bank established to assist small businesses. Research institutes in the area would focus on developing technologies to create employment. More money and attention should be given to programs to limit population growth.
The compact would be a genuinely multilateral effort. It would not curb migration by promoting development, but would expand opportunities in the countries from which most migrants come so that they can cope with the consequences of a new United States immigration law.
The United States should negotiate such a compact before Congress completes action on curbing illegal migration.  Failure to do so would mean that the United States would exchange one aspect of the problem for another -and later find itself absorbing refugees fleeing violence instead of undocumented workers seeking work. There is no escaping the links between migration, development, and political change in the Basin.
During the last two decades, the Caribbean Basin became the largest source of migration to the United States - approximately one-third of all legal immigrants, two-thirds of all political refugees, and ninetenths of all undocumented workers.
Ten percent or more of the population of many Basin countries already live in the United States and contribute economically and culturally and in making United States citizens more sensitive to the many sides of political change in the region.
The possibility of negotiating such a compact will increase as nations like Mexico begin to cope with illegal migrants from Central America.
They will also soon have to face the fact that their own ''escape valve'' to the United States may be a short-term solution - releasing potentially explosive tensions caused by high unemployment - and a long-term problem.
A nation that exports its problem of unemployment has little incentive to solve it by making difficulty internal adjustments or investing more in labor-intensive than capital-intensive projects.
By gradually closing the valve, while at the same time adding resources as part of a comprehensive plan for the entire region, the compact would help these countries employ those who remain as well as those who return.
The United States has a more powerful reason than anti-Communism for undertaking this effort: Ours is a Caribbean nation.

Immigration1.0-34309,FOREIGN WORKERS WHO FLED LANGUISH AT KUWAIT BORDER,1980,9,new york times,"By PRANAY B. GUPTE, Special to the New York Times",section a,615.0,"Hundreds of immigrant workers who fled from the fighting between Iraq and Iran are camped in the open at this border post, waiting for a way to get home.
These refugees are Pakistanis, Indians and Bangladeshis, mostly laborers who were part of the great migratory wave that brought thousands of workers from the subcontinent to the Middle East to work in the oilfields and at huge construction projects associated with oil.
None of the refugees have much money and most of them are illiterate. They dashed here, from nearby Basra in Iraq. A few managed to pack some clothes into cardboard suitcases.
AN-ATransistor Radio Saved
Karam Singh, a bricklayer, was lucky enough to carry his transistor radio so he has become a popular man here. Another bricklayer, Prem Singh, lost his passport and identity papers when Iranian planes made rubble of his Basra home last week.
Abdali is about 80 miles from the city of Kuwait. There is no vegetation, only sand. Water has to be ferried from an oasis at nearby Rozteen. It was possible today to watch Iranian and Iraqi jets chasing one another in the brilliant blue sky. Occasionally, the ground would shake as a bomb fell across the border in Iraq. The sky last night sparkled with antiaircraft fire, mortars and tracers from warring planes. Few of the refugees in Abdali slept much last night.
They have seen their livelihood go up in flames. and some had friends among the 25 who died in the Iranian bombing raids in Basra.

A Slain Friend Left Behind
''How will I face my friend's family?'' asked Sahdev Singh. ''We left Punjab together two years ago. Now I am going back alone while my friend Hari lies dead.''
''When will we go home?'' asked Uday Jeet, a carpenter who was working on a jetty near Basra when Iranian planes struck. ''Why is it that they have gone but not us?''
The ''they'' he was talking about are the 155 Americans, 250 Britons and hundreds of Japanese, South Koreans, Poles, Italians, Yugoslavs, West Germans and Frenchmen. They were technicians who worked in petrochemical plants and at construction sites in Basra and although they fled here too, they did not stay. Their governments or employers had arranged it so that most were aboard planes headed for home within hours of leaving Iraq.
But for men like Karam Chand and Mohammed Ahmed there were no such arrangements. Their employers, Japanese and Indian subcontractors, do not even have representatives in Kuwait, so these refugees have no one to turn to for assistance.
Today, when Surbirjit Singh Chhatwal, the Indian Ambassador to Kuwait, visited the area, he was besieged by hundreds of men who pleaded for help in getting home.

Food and Blankets Supplied
''It is heart-breaking,'' Ambassador Chhatawal said, as he walked around the encampment. He had arrived with a physician, Dr. P.S.  Sahni, and a man named Narinder Singh, a wealthy business executive in Kuwait who has brought food, blankets and essential supplies to the refugees over the last few days.
''It's the least that can be done for you,'' the tall Sikh said in Punjabi, the native language of the majority of the men. ''I want to assure you that every effort is being made to get you home.''
Nearly a thousand other Indians and Pakistanis left Kuwait early this morning for their homes, their passage paid for by relatives or employers. Most of them were men with more education and better jobs than those who are still at Abdali.
They have been assured by representatives of their respective governments that they will be able to get aboard planes for home over the next few days, but no specific date has been given and so some of the refugees, at least, are skeptical.

Immigration1.0-34866,HAITIANS ARRIVE IN BROOKLYN AND LAKE PLACID,1981,7,new york times,By EDWARD A. GARGAN,section a,692.0,"Federal officials over the weekend began moving several hundred Haitians to detention centers around the country, including an immigration center in Brooklyn and a Federal prison near Lake Placid, N.Y., in an effort to ease serious overcrowding at a Miami camp.
The Haitians, illegal aliens who have been fleeing their country in boats for several years, are being relocated to Federal prisons and to detention centers run by the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, a spokesman for the Justice Department said.
Fifty men and 36 women were taken Saturday to a decrepit, fivestory red brick building across from the Brooklyn Navy Yard in a rundown section of Fort Greene. Private security guards who were armed supplemented Immigration and Naturalization officers, none of whom would permit reporters to visit the Haitians.
Federal officials move several hundred Haitians to detention centers around country, including Brooklyn and Lake Placid (NY), from Miami (Fla) camp
''We have an emergency condition here with the overcrowding,'' said Michael Trominski, an immigration officer at the Krome Avenue North Refugee Camp, west of Miami. A former Army missile base, the makeshift tent and barrack encampment with a capacity for 550 people now houses nearly 1,200 refugees, Mr. Trominski said.

10 More to Lake Placid
Immigration officials transferred 90 Haitians from the overcrowded Miami camp yesterday, sending 50 refugees to a Federal facility in West Virginia and 40 more to a new Federal prison in Lake Placid.  Twenty more Haitians will be flown out today, 10 to Texas and 10 to Lake Placid.
In addition to the 86 Haitians who were brought to Brooklyn on Saturday, 176 were flown to a minimum security Federal prison camp in Big Spring, Tex. Last week, 58 children who escaped to this country from Haiti without their parents were taken to Dutchess County in upstate New York for adoption.
The transfers of the Haitians, which according to Mr. Trominski were ordered by William French Smith, the United States Attorney General, came on the heels of a suit filed by Bob Graham, the Governor of Florida, who is seeking to force the Federal Government to reduce the refugee population at the Krome Avenue camp by 1,000 by Friday. The Justice Department is continuing its search for space in Federal detention facilities but there are no firm plans for future transfers, Mr. Trominski said.
Mr. Trominski also said that the Governor of Puerto Rico had endorsed a plan by Federal officials to use an empty Navy facility there to house Haitian refugees. Puerto Rican officials had been opposed to the use of the facility until now.

Deportation Hearings Halted
Deportations of Haitians were halted last month following charges by attorneys for the refugees that the Haitians were being denied due process of law. They said deportation hearings were held in locked courtrooms, from which private lawyers and spectators were barred.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service suspended deportation proceedings pending a review of its procedures.
Severe overcrowding at the Miami camp has caused serious sanitation problems, including the contamination of the camp's drinking water, Mr. Trominski said.
Between 1,000 and 1,500 Haitians arrive by boat every month, said Thomas M. Stewart, a spokesman for the Justice Department.  ''It's an enormous bureaucratic problem keeping tabs on all of them,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''There are more than 15,000 who are in exclusion or deportation proceedings right now.'' Many of the Haitians not held at the camp have been sponsored by voluntary agencies in Miami communities, and are being taken care of by private families.
During the transfers, 50 riot-equipped Border Patrol officers flown in from Texas to Miami surrounded the buses carrying the refugees to the airport. But the Haitians filed quietly onto the chartered passenger jet.
At the Federal prison facilities in Texas, West Virginia and Lake Placid, the refugees will be segregated from the general prison population, Mr. Stewart said.

Immigration1.0-35284,IMMIGRATION AGENCY CURBED IN SEARCH ES FOR ALIENS,1982,1,new york times,"By NATHANIEL SHEPPARD Jr., Special to the New York Times",section 1,784.0,"A Federal district judge here has permanently enjoined the Immigration and Naturalization Service from surrounding or invading factories and homes and then forcibly interrogating Hispanic Americans on the status of their citizenship.
But the judge, Prentice Marshall, refused to enjoin the Federal agency from randomly stopping and interrogating Hispanic Americans on the street, saying the legality of this practice would have to be resolved at trial. Judge Marshall said a trial date would be set on Jan. 27.
The judge's actions Wednesday grew out of an eight-year-old lawsuit filed by the Illinois Migrant Council, a private, nonprofit corporation, and eight defendants who said they had been harassed, abused and in some instances improperly arrested by immigration agents looking for illegal aliens.
Federal district judge in Chicago (Ill) permanently enjoins Immigration and Naturalization Service from forcibly interrogating Hispanic Americans
In 1975 a preliminary injunction was issued prohibiting the service from entering residences of Mexicans or Spanish-surnamed people without valid warrants to search or arrest them or without probable cause to enter without such warrants unless the occupants voluntarily let them in.

Other Provisions of Injunction
The injunction also enjoined the agents from arresting, stopping, detaining or interrogating Hispanic Americans by force, without valid search or arrest warrants, or without reasonable suspicion based on specific facts that they were illegal aliens unlawfully in the United States. The injunction allows the agents to question Hispanic Americans publicly about their citizenship if they volunteer to be questioned and are not coerced. The ruling covers the Northern District of Illinois, which is served by Judge Marshall.
The case has dragged on largely because of appeals by the immigration service.  The permanent injunction binds the service to the same restrictions as the preliminary injunction with the exception of street searches.  The plaintiffs and defendants dispute whether the street interrogations are conducted as a result of voluntary cooperation or detention and coercion.
Judge Marshall said both sides had presented evidence to support their contentions but that neither had been convincing and therefore the issue must be resolved at trial.
Edward J. Moran, an Assistant United States Attorney, and Theodore L. Giorgetti, assistant district director for the immigration service, refused comment on Judge Marshall's ruling.

Voluntary Cooperation Disputed
In its efforts to justify its ''area control'' sweeps of homes and factories, the immigration service contended that the operations were conducted only with the voluntary cooperation of those at the premises and that its agents did not force anyone to remain on the premises.
Judge Marshall said he found thi s assertion ''inherently incredible'' and without ''support in the stipulated facts'' in the case.
He said, however, that there existed ''a genuine issue of material fact'' on the issue of street interrogations. ''Each side has submitted evidence which supports its view of what the I.N.S. policy and practice actually are; neither side's evidence is conclusive.  Since the evidence is in conflict, this question must be resolved at trial.''
The plaintiffs alleged that they and other Hispanic Americans ''have been subjected to numerous interrogations'' by immigration agents ''on public streets, in their work places, and in their homes'' and that many of these incidents ''led to detentions and arrests although they were citizens or permanent residents of the U.S.''
Two years ago, a Federal judge in California issued an injunction against the agency similar to the injunction issued in Chicago Tuesday. But the legality of the agency's policy of random street interrogations of persons who appear to be of Hispanic descent, which has become a heated issue in Hispanic American communities around the country, has not been reviewed by a Federal court. The forthcoming trial on the issue here would provide the first test of what the agency considers an important tool in identifying illegal aliens.
The immigration agency temporarily halted the street encounters in 1980 at the request of the Bureau of the Census, whose officials argued that the interrogations made it even more difficult for census takers to get an accurate count of Hispanic-Americans. The street interrogations have now resumed.

Immigration1.0-34287,IMMIGRATION BILLS AND THE LESSON OF THE HELSTOSKI CASECASE,1980,10,new york times,,section a,577.0,"To the Editor:
Your editorial on private immigration bills (Oct. 16) reiterates a misconception of the Helstoski case which has contributed to the blasting of an outstanding, 12-year Congressional career and the denial to the people of the Ninth Congressional District of New Jersey of the services of a dedicated public figure.
It is true that the U.S. attorney withdrew the bribery prosecution after the Supreme Court ruled that Helstoski's legislative acts (e.g., the introduction of bills) could not be proved in court. What is overlooked, however, is that the Supreme Court plainly permitted the attorney to try to prove that Helstoski had taken money and had promised to perform legislative acts (the sort of proof which is at the heart of the Abscam cases).
AN-A
The Supreme Court was indubitably correct in its decision. If legislative acts of members of Congress become the grist of Federal prosecutors, grand juries and criminal-trial juries, the underlying concept of a free and independent legislative body uncoerced by the executive or judicial branches of our Government, is gravely threatened. On the other hand, the Court in Helstoski, as it had done previously, emphasized that non-legislative acts of members of Congress, e.g., taking bribes, were well within the ambit of the Federal prosecutorial process.
Since it had been familiar law that legislative acts could not be proved, it is obvious that the reiteration of that principle in Helstoski had nothing to do with the U.S. attorney's decision to drop the bribery charges. The reason he did so was that he finally realized that his case, shorn of impermissible evidence, came to rest upon the testimony of two persons who had been caught in flagrant violation of law and who bought their way out (freedom from prosecution in one case, and a mild sentence in the other) by satisfying the ill-concealed desire of the U.S. attorney to add Helstoski's scalp to his prosecutorial belt.
Against those two witnesses there would have been an outpouring of testimony from constituents who over the years had been helped by an extraordinarily devoted Congressman with never a hint of anything expected in return. The Supreme Court's decision became an excuse, therefore, to drop what appeared to be a losing prosecution that at the time seemed not to matter; Mr. Helstoski's career had already been destroyed by the indictment, which had been extant for more than three years.
The lesson of the Helstoski case, therefore, is not that private immigration bills are bad. They provide healthy movement of the joints in what is otherwise a rigid, impersonal and sometimes unjust immigration-law system. The lesson of the Helstoski case is rather that Federal prosecutors, some of whom are bent on the use of their offices for career development, can use their inordinate power to destroy decent people.
Perhaps it has escaped the attention of The Times, although it is a matter of record, that it was Henry Helstoski himself who caused the initiation of the F.B.I. investigation which the U.S. attorney turned against him. Unfortunately, in this post-Watergate era, any politician who is so much as charged with crime is presumed guilty.
There is no easy remedy, but at least the media ought not exacerbate the problem, as I am afraid you have done in your interpretation of the Helstoski case in your editorial.
MORTON STAVIS, Newark, Oct. 16, 1980
The writer is Mr. Helstoski's attorney.

Immigration1.0-34269,IMMIGRATION PANEL TO MEET IN PRIVATE,1980,11,new york times,By ROBERT PEAR,section 1,825.0,"Immigration lawyers and citizen groups expressed anger yesterday after learning that a Federal commission recommending major changes in immigration policy would hold most of its last scheduled session in private at a secluded resort.
Four Cabinet officers including Attorney General Benjamin R.  Civiletti, eight members of Congress and four public members serve on the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, which is scheduled to meet Dec. 5 through 7 at the Tides Lodge on the Rappahannock River in Irvington, Va. The Commission is scheduled to meet for a total of 23 1/2 hours, according to a notice published in the Federal Register. All but three and a half hours on the afternoon of Dec. 7 will be closed to the public.
Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy will hold private session at secluded resort in Irvington (Va)
The Rev . Theodore M. Hesburgh, president of the University of NotreDame and chairman of the 16-member commission , said it was necessary to exclude the public from ''our last and mos t important meeting'' because the agenda included ''ticklish questi ons of national security,'' affecting relations with Mexico a nd other countries. He said that the decision to close the meeting w as final and would not be reconsidered.
Father Hesburgh said in an interview that the commission, created by Congress in 1978, wanted to develop a ''consensus on major final recommendations.'' The panel, he said, will submit its report to the President and Congress by March 1.

Criticism From Interest Groups
Immigration lawyers, civil libertarians, refugee resettlement workers and special interest groups denounced the decision to close most of the session as contrary to the spirit of Federal laws requiring open government. Attorneys for a group representing Haitian refugees said that they might file a lawsuit to gain access.
Phyllis Eisen, a spokesman for Zero Population Growth, a nonprofit group interested in population policy and immigration, said she was ''incensed'' at the commission's decision to meet in private.  ''Politicians have a right to get together and cut deals, but these are not just politicians,'' she said. ''They are public commissioners operating on public money.''
David Carliner, the author of a handbook on the rights of aliens who is chairman of the immigration committee of the American Bar Assocation, complained in a letter to Father Hesburgh that the meeting was being held ''in an isolated location, which is virtually inaccessible to the public.'' The site, near the point where the Rappahannock flows into the Chesapeake Bay, is a three-hour drive from Washington.
At the session, commissioners will try to develop recommendations on such controversial issues as a national identity card, numerical limits on immigration, amnesty for illegal aliens already in the United States, penalties for employers who hire illegal aliens, asylum for political dissidents, selection criteria for new immigrants, deportation procedures and admission of temporary workers from Mexico.

Harris Opposes Decision
A spokesman for one member of the commission, Patricia Roberts Harris, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said that she had opposed the choice of a ''remote'' location and the decision to close most of the session. ''She knew of no national security considerations'' that would require closed sessions, said the spokesman, Bill M. Wise.
Father Hesburgh asked for permission to close most of the meeting in a five-page letter to the head of the General Services Administration, the Federal housekeeping and supply agency.  Commission officials said that the President had designated the agency to review such requests. Ray Kline, deputy administrator of the agency, approved the request on Nov. 7.
Dale Frederick Swartz, director of the alien rights project of the Lawyers Committee for Civil rights Under Law, asserted that some members of the commission ''have not done their homework'' and did not want that fact disclosed at a public meeting. In private, he said, commissioners may advocate positions that they would not defend in public.
In his letter asking for permission to close the meeting, Father Hesburgh said that the commission had held public hearings in 12 cities and conducted 25 public consultations with experts.
The Cabinet officers on the commission, besides Mrs. Harris, and Attorney General Civiletti are Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie, and Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall. They will all be replaced by their counterparts in the incoming administration after Presidentelect Ronald Reagan takes office on Jan. 20. Commission members said they were unsure whether the new appointees would endorse their report.

Immigration1.0-34280,Increasing Role for Immigration Seen in U.S. Population Growth,1980,11,new york times,AP,section 1,158.0,"A private study group has predicted that immigration will play an increasing role in United States population growth in coming years.
Currently, according to the report from the Population Reference Bureau, immigration accounts for nearly half of the nation's population increase.
Private study asserts immigration will play greater role in U.S.  population increase in coming yearsThe country receives about 700,000 legal immigrants annually, plus illegal arrivals estimated at between 100,000 and 500,000, said the report, made public Thursday.
If combined legal and illegal immigration proceeded at a total of about one million a year, the report by Leon F. Bouvier said, and if there was no change in current low fertility rates, the population would reach more than 310 million in 50 years.
Because the current fertility rate of 1.8 is not sufficient to replace people who die, immigration would eventually become the sole source of increase, the report says.

Officials of Reagan Administration defend its policy of intercepting would-be Haitian immigrants at sea and returning them to Haiti
He said that multiple layers of review of decisions to deny Haitians asylum as political refugees had ""bogged the whole thing down"" and prevented or delayed expulsion of thousands of Haitians who have landed illegally in Florida.
But John Shattuck, head of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington office, testified that ""many bona fide refugees are unlikely to be returned to Haiti for persecution, imprisonment without charge and even death"" under the policy, which was also strong criticism from immigration lawyers who testified.
The Administration has had a Coast Guard cutter on patrol in international waters near Haiti since Oct. 9 under an agreement with Haiti.

Immigration1.0-34333,IRANIAN DEMONSTRATORS AND DUE PROCESS,1980,8,new york times,,section 1,262.0,"To the Editor:
The recent episode involving the mass arrest of nearly 200 pro-Khomeini demonstrators and their subsequent 10-day detention raises fundamental questions involving our nation's commitment to the constitutional guarantees of free speech, assembly and due process of law.
A large group of people were subjected to special immigration inquiries merely because of their participation in a political demonstration, and were detained without any reasonable basis to believe they were in violation of immigration laws.
AN-A
Only last year, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that an individual may not be detained by the police merely because he refuses to provide identification. That principle, basic to our concept of liberty, applies to I.N.S. officials as well as to the police.
Indeed, a Federal court in New York held unconstitutional the I.N.S. practice of mass detentions of large numbers of suspected aliens absent reasonable suspicion that each and every person so detained is an alien illegally present in the United States. The I.N.S. position vis-a-vis the Iranian demonstrators stands in stark contradiction to these judicial precedents.
It is a measure of the strength of our society that we can tolerate the exercise of free speech and assembly even by those whose motivations may be questioned and with whom we may most vigorously disagree. Unfortunately, I.N.S. officials who have sworn to uphold the law have instead violated it.

Immigration1.0-34335,IRANIANS TESTING THE LIMITS OF U.S. JUSTICE,1980,8,new york times,By ROBERT PEAR,section 4,1092.0,"An international political controversy spilled into the streets of the nation's capital last week, raising fresh questions about the rights of aliens to express unpopular views.
Just as supporters and opponents of the Shah clashed here three years ago, when the Iranian monarch visited the White House, friends and foes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini have recently been confronting each other in demonstrations here. Nearly 200 Iranian students were arrested late last month at a demonstration in support of the Ayatollah and spent 10 days in prison.
As soon as they were released, they returned to Washington to participate in yet another demonstration, protesting, among other things, their treatment in prison. Angry onlookers jeered and heckled the
AN-A
Iranian demonstrators, who seemed eager to provoke just such a reaction. For its part, Teheran saw a victory for Islam in the release of the protesters from American prisons. ''After 10 days,'' Teheran radio said, ''the savage police of Washington and the ruthless and cruel police of the U.S. Immigration Department at last retreated in the face of the brave struggles of our beloved sisters and brothers.''
The Iranian demonstrations and the treatment of the protesters by Federal authorities raised several questions to which there were no simple answers. To what extent are aliens protected by the Constitution? To what extent do they enjoy First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly? Can immigration laws be used as an instrument of foreign policy? Does the Immigration and Naturalization Service consult with the State Department in deciding how to enforce the law?
Justice Department officials insisted that the treatment of the Iranian protesters was strictly in accordance with immigration laws and that the political beliefs of the protestors were not a consideration. The State Department insisted that it had not sought lenient treatment for the Iranian prisoners in an effort to avoid harm to the American hostages. Consultations between the two agencies were apparently informal and the details were kept secret.
The District of Columbia police said that the 192 Khomeini supporters were arrested after they pushed through a police line on July 27 and tried to disrupt an anti-Khomeini rally. The Iranians, initially held in the city jail on disorderly conduct charges, were transferred to Federal custody and taken to New York for possible deportation proceedings because they refused to disclose their names.
Under rules issued last November by the Justice Department, Iranian students must make ''full and truthful disclosure of all information requested.'' Officials said the Iranians were violating this requirement until they identified themselves.
It was announced, after rather hurried checks of the files, that all the Iranian prisoners were ''in status'' - in compliance with the law and with the terms of their visas. That finding surprised Justice Department officials (who maintain that a fair percentage of any foreign student group usually has visa problems) and suggested that the demonstrators had been carefully selected.
On the other hand, immigration officers who interviewed the Iranians said that many had been released prematurely, that some were indeed ''out of status.'' The Justice Department is conducting an internal investigation to determine what actually happened.  Preliminary evidence suggests problems, at the very least, in the way information was transmitted and decisions made within the immigration service, a beleaguered agency in the best of times.

A Policy of Extremes?
The Iranian demonstrators, it seemed clear, were testing the limits of the First Amendment. The Bill of Rights applies to ''people'' in the United States, not to citizens alone, and civil libertarians have successfully asserted many claims on behalf of aliens. But Federal courts have also upheld the power of Congress to enact restrictions on classes of foreigners.
''Any policy toward aliens is vitally and intricately interwoven with contemporaneous policies in regard to the conduct of foreign relations, the war power and the maintenance of a republican form of government,'' the Supreme Court of the United States said in a 1951 decision upholding the deportation of three resident aliens who had once been members of the Communist Party. ''Such matters are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of government as to be largely immune from judicial inquiry or interference.''
Just as Congress has ''plenary power'' over immigration matters, the executive branch has substantial discretion in administering the law. At one extreme is the tough Federal policy toward Iranians: Students already here were required to report to the nearest immigration service offices last November. Visas issued to Iranian citizens for future entry into the United States were invalidated in April. At the other extreme is the generous policy toward Cuban refugees, who have been welcomed with financial assistance for two decades. Somewhere in between are the hapless Haitian refugees, who faced expulsion from the United States until a Federal judge ordered the immigration service to reconsider their asylum claims last month.
Congress has not enacted special punitive measures against Iranians, but Representative Kent R. Hance, a Texas Democrat, has asked for hearings to investigate ''possible subversive actions'' by Iranian students in this country. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has some evidence to suggest that Iran sent money to the United States to help Khomeini supporters foment civil disturbances.
Harsh actions against the Iranians in this country might be politically popular, but many diplomats, educators and specialists on Iranian affairs oppose such measures. The American Foreign Service Association, the professional organization of career diplomats, said the fact that aliens could express their views here, in a nation of laws, ''stands in stark contrast to the violations of law and of human dignity'' suffered by the hostages in Iran. Or, as a Justice Department official said, ''We must not let the passions of the moment outweigh good long-term practice and procedure.''

Immigration1.0-34838,ISLAND AIDES DRIVE ON 'ALIEN INSECTS',1981,8,new york times,By JOAN LEE FAUST,section 11,1040.0,"WHEN insects enter this country from other lands, they are considered illegal aliens. Unless they are discovered and eradicated promptly, troubles often follow because these insects have no natural enemies here to keep them in check.
The Northeast's continuing battles with Japanese beetles and gypsy moths and the West Coast's recent near-disaster with Mediterranean fruit flies are only recent examples of what can happen when foreign insect pests get on the loose. Although many insects fly undetected back and forth across borders, their chief gateways are this nation's ports of entry - by land, sea and air.
Federal Government selects John F Kennedy Airport as one of 21 ports in a High-Hazard Project intensifying efforts to check 'alien insects'
John F. Kennedy International Airport, one of the nation's busiest, has been selected by the Federal Government as one of 21 ports in a High-Hazard Project to search out and destroy alien plant pests and diseases before they threaten important economic crops. Although Federal inspectors are at the customs gates of entry ports, there is always the chance that hitchhiker insect pests or diseases slip through.
The High-Hazard Project, which began four years ago, is being coordinated by Federal inspectors and administrators in the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture with headquarters in Hyattsville, Md.  Officials of the inspection agency administer Federal regulations that prohibit or restrict the entry of foreign pests and plants.  They maintain inspection services at all major ports and administer regulatory and control programs.
Don Woodham, technical coordinator for the project, said that the agency was making intensified efforts to detect any insect pests or diseases that might come into these ports and squelch them before they become established in agricultural areas. Fruit flies, boll weevils, Japanese beetles, nematodes, chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease are a few of the insects and plant diseases that have been introduced at ports of entry over the years.
''New York is a high-risk port mainly because of its size and its interception records,'' Mr. Woodham said. As part of the new effort to stop troubles before they start, the High-Hazard Project is concentrating efforts in a 100-mile radius of each of the 21 ports of entry.
Unlike many port areas where there are vast agricultural crops - sugar cane, rice, grain, forests and citrus orchards - Long Island has many large-sized home vegetable gardens that attract a variety of insects. The local APHIS agency has sought the aid of these home gardeners and asked those interested in cooperating with the survey to send postcards and sign up.
The cards should be mailed to John Arcery, APHIS, PPQ, J.F. Kennedy International Airport, Cargo Building, Number 80, Room 103, Jamaica, N.Y. 11430. Although the program is well filled for this year, the agency is interested in having the names of home gardeners who would like to cooperate in the future.
John Arcery, a plant protection and quarantine inspector, is interested only in large gardens (the minimum size is 15 by 30 feet). ''So far, 23 gardens have been surveyed and there are 20 more to go,'' he said.
Those crops of particular interest to Mr. Arcery are potatoes, cucumbers, melons, lettuce, onions, beans, beets, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and tomatoes. ''Home gardens have a variety of hosts and we are interested in the pests that feed on them,'' Mr. Arcery said.
During a recent tour, he and Janice Yee, an agency assistant, inspected two gardens on the Island, those of Edward Kmiotek in Massapequa and John Boles in Wantagh.
To survey gardens, Mr. Arcery and Miss Yee work from the outer edges inward. With knapsacks on their backs and collecting vials in hand, they closely examine vegetables and fruit and look for leaves damaged by insect feeding or disease. Any blemished fruit is cut open to see what is at work and, if found, the culprit is collected for further identification. Insects found on backs of leaves are put into the small vials filled with alcohol, and beetles and caterpillars are caught in small boxes.
When inspection is completed, the collection is taken back to agency offices for positive identification. Mr. Arcery said that most of the insects collected were routine local ones. But any pest not quickly identified is checked out with a staff entomologist, and, if he is stumped, the pest is sent to headquarters for definite identification.
''So far nothing out of the ordinary has been picked up in the garden surveys,'' Mr. Arcery said. ''If it is, we would search and destroy by going back to the area to check for more of the particular insect and measures would be taken to eradicate it promptly.''
In addition to the garden surveys, the High-Hazard Project puts out blacklight insect traps. Four are set up at key locations on the Island and turned on weekly for one 24-hour period. This weekly trapping supplies sufficient volume to survey an insect population in a given area, particularly where there are important food crops.
There are thousands of insect species throughout the world. Mr.  Woodham said that four years ago, the agency's master, or ''most wanted,'' list comprised about 100 insect species. This year, after more has been learned about pests worldwide, the list numbers nearly 300 insects that could be problems if allowed to enter this country.
As any traveler abroad from this country has learned, all food, plant and animal products must be declared. Smuggling of these products is a Federal offense. Among the 240,000 prohibited plant products confiscated at ports of entry each year, more than 10,000 exotic plant pests and diseases have been uncovered.
A U.S.D.A. permit is required before certain plant materials can be brought into the United States. These include fruits, vegetables and plants or plant parts. These permits can be obtained from the Permit Unit, U.S.D.A.-APHIS-PPQ, 638 Federal Building, Hyattsville, Md.  20782.

Immigration1.0-35003,ISRAELI EMIGRATION INSPIRES ANGER AND FEAR,1981,1,new york times,By HENRY KAMM,section 4,1090.0,"With ''descents'' rising and ''ascents'' declining, each to record levels, 1980 was a bitter year for Israel. The mystical character of the words Zionists use to describe, respectively, emigration of a Jew from Israel or his immigration to the Jewish state shows the high degree of emotion contained in demographic statistics in this country and explains the bitterness.
Definitive emigration statistics are unavailable in Israel, as is the case in all open societies that do not require from their citizens an accounting of their intentions every time they leave.  But immigration authorities keep track of the total number of Israelis who depart and who return; emigration estimates are based on the difference between them. The difference last year was about 30,000.
Statistics revealing that more Jews are leaving Israel than coming to live there concerns officials who say drop in population was 30,000 in 1980
The previous record year was 1974 when, following the 1973 war, 25,000 more Israelis left than returned. When a resident has been gone for four years, the Central Bureau of Statistics lists him as an emigrant. The record total was again in 1974, 16,400. Last year is likely, four years hence, to surpass that record.
The bottom year of 1974 was followed by a contraction of emigration; the difference between departures and returns was down to 7,000 in 1979. Thus, last year's 30,000 total was not only a record but also marked a dramatic reversal in the trend of outflow.
Perhaps even more dramatic than the rise in departures was the decline in new immigrants. Last year's total of about 21,000 represents a drop of more than 40 percent from 1979. Even more frightening to Israel, last month was the first month in the 12 years in which fewer than 1,000 Jews made their ''aliyah'' or ascent.
Not all of the drop is due to a lack of desire among Diaspora Jews to come here. The Soviet Union, through the 1970's the principal source of immigration, has reduced the outflow of Jews by more than half. In 1979, 51,317 Jews left; the total for the first 11 months of last year was 20,583. The percentage of Soviet emigres who chose to come to Israel remained steady at about 35 percent.
''It's nothing short of a disaster,'' said a senior official of the Jewish Agency, the semi-official body responsible for attracting and settling immigrants.
Although both the rate of arrival and of departure cause great concern, the principal focus recently has been on Israelis who leave. One reason was the leaking of an internal report by a Jewish Agency official on Israelis in the United States. The document put the cumulative total at as high as 500,000, or roughly one-sixth of Israel's Jewish population.
The Central Bureau of Statistics rejects this estimate. Its records indicate that about 350,000 Israelis have left the country for all destinations since its founding in 1948. But whatever the statistics, emigration is clearly on the increase, and therein lies the deeper reason for the anguished and angry debate. In a country founded within recent memory and based on an act of faith that is under increasing challenge from the non-Jewish world, departure from Israel, particularly of Israeli-born Jews, not immigrants who have found the going too tough, is a defection from an embattled cause. An Irishman or Italian who leaves his country in hard times for a land of greater economic opportunity is not seen as deserting or endangering the existence of Ireland or Italy. ''Yeridah,'' the descent of a Jew from Israel, is viewed as all of that and more.
Resentment From Those Who Stay
''A person leaving the country denies his personal role in the rebuilding of the Jewish state and contradicts the raison d'etre of the Jewish state,'' said the Jewish Agency official, an academic who weighs and moderates his words. ''The Diaspora is a disease, and we should have nothing to do with Israelis who join it,'' said Geula Cohen, an ultranationalistic member of the Knesset, in an inconclusive parliamentary debate last week. Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, a man not given to verbal excess, once referred to yeridah, in contemptuous Hebrew, as ''the dropping off of the weaklings.''
Israelis deeply regret the sharp decline in aliyah, and extremists like Mrs. Cohen no doubt equate the failure of all of the world's Jews to gather in Israel with disloyalty to Jewishness. But there is a vast difference in mainstream Israeli perception between Jews who prefer to remain in the Diaspora - the majority - and those who, in effect, take the active step of rejecting the Jewish homeland.
A usually mild-mannered Israeli, forgiving of human failings and understanding even of Israel's Arab enemies, surprised a friend with an unwonted note of steel in his voice when he said, ''Let them go, those who don't want to say.'' And jabbing the air with a clenched fist, he added, ''but don't make it easy for them to come back.''
Israeli anger is keenest at the native-born citizens who leave. No figures are available, because of the paucity of emigration data collected, but New Yorkers know that Hebrew has become a frequently heard language and the sabra accent in English has a familiar ring on Manhattan's West Side.
While the decline in new immigrants is conceded by Israeli officials to be at least in part due to Israel's isolation and the decline in its international standing, Israelis of all political stripes ascribe emigration entirely to economic factors. Runaway inflation, which when last year's figures are tabulated will show a rate of at least 135 percent, Government budget cuts that affect employment opportunities and reduce Government investment and support for the private sector, a serious housing problem and a decline in public confidence that the economy can right itself are factors that enter into all decisions to leave. A high proportion of emigres are middle class people for whom opportunities for self-improvement in a richer economy - more university posts, more and better equipped laboratories, more research grants - abound in the United States.
Looking desperately for a silver lining, the Jewish Agency official said, ''Given the situation in which Israel has found itself for almost 33 years, one often wonders why the rate of emigration isn't higher still.''

Immigration1.0-34363,JUDGE ASSAILS U.S. HANDLING OF HAITIANS,1980,7,new york times,By JOHN M. CREWDSON,section a,1101.0,"A Federal district judge declared today that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had knowingly violated ''the constitutional, statutory, treaty and administrative rights'' of thousands of Haitian refugees seeking political asylum in this country.
Judge James L. King, ruling in a class-action lawsuit brought by more than 4,000 Haitians, ordered that the service take no further action against the plaintiffs until the Government had presented him with an acceptable plan for reconsidering their asylum claims. That plan, he said, must eliminate the ''wholesale violations of due process'' that he found had characterized the service's previous denials of those claims.
''Haitians who came to the United States seeking freedom and justice did not find it,'' Judge King wrote in a 180-page decision.  Instead, he said, ''they were confronted with an Immigration and Naturalization Service determined to deport them,'' and to do so ''irrespective of the merits of their asylum claims.''
AN-A
The Haitians had contended that the mere act of seeking political asylum in the United States would prompt the Government of Jean-Claude Duvalier, Haiti's President-for-Life, to view them as opponents of his regime, and that many of them would be subject to political persecution if forced to return home. They sought review of asylum claims that have been denied, and an end to practices that violated their rights.
The Government had argued that nearly all the Haitians here were merely seeking better economic conditions and faced no threat of political persecution upon return. But Judge King dismissed that position as unsupported by the evidence presented in the year-long trial here that ended May 21.
''The court has seen a stark picture of how these plaintiffimmigrants will be treated if they return to Haiti,'' he wrote, ''and it has seen an equally stark, and even more troubling, picture of the treatment of Haitians by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.''
In unusually scathing judicial criticism of an executive agency, Judge King also suggested that officials of the service had been motivated to some degree by racial prejudice in seeking mass deportation of the Haitians.

No Explanation But Bias
''The plaintiffs are part of the first substantial flight of black refugees from a repressive regime to this country,'' he said, adding that while ''prejudice of any type is seldom overt,'' he could place no other interpretation on some key pieces of evidence, including an internal immigration service memorandum asserting that the Haitians threatened the economic and social ''well-being'' of Miami.
Judge King characterized as ''stark, brutal and bloody'' the testimony and other evidence offered by the Haitians to show that many of those deported to Haiti had been badly mistreated, imprisoned and even murdered upon their return. He declared that ''until the I.N.S. can definitely state which Haitians will be so treated and which will not, the brutality and the bloodletting is its reponsibility.''
Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the immigration service, said in Washington that his agency would have no comment on the decision.  Robert Havel, a spokesmen for the Justice Department, said it would be some time before a decision was reached on whether to appeal today's ruling. The department, of which the service is a part, was the defendant in the lawsuit.

Administration's 'Parole'
The practical benefit of today's decision for the Haitian plaintiffs is unclear. On June 20 the Carter Administration, which had been under considerable pressure from the Congressional Black Caucus to respond to the Haitians' plight, granted a temporary ''parole'' allowing the Haitians and the recent Cuban refugees to remain in this country for at least six months.
This ''parole,'' which can be renewed, is intended to give Congress time to pass legislation that would allow the Haitians to become permanent residents and, eventually, citizens of the United States.  But the order applies only to the estimated 30,000 Haitians living here as of June 20, and those arriving later still will be subject to deportation unless granted asylum by the service.
The plaintiffs in the suit before Judge King are covered by the parole order, and presumably would have no reason to pursue asylum claims unless their parole expired before Congress had granted them permanent resident status.
The Justice Department had based its defense primarily on State Department interviews with 86 of the 700 or so Haitians who have been deported or have returned to Haiti voluntarily.
None of the 86 acknowledged having been persecuted or otherwise mistreated, the State Department said. All conceded fleeing Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, for economic and not political reasons, it said.
But Judge King dismissed this study as methodologically unsound and ''unworthy of belief.'' His courtroom, he said, had become ''populated by the ghosts of individual Haitians - including those who have been returned from the United States -who have been beaten, tortured and left to die in Haitian prisons.'' Those not imprisoned, he added, faced harassment and intimidation and ''the continuing threat of a midnight visit'' from the Haitian secret police.
The immigration service, the judge said, had also ''demonstrated its failure to grasp the fundamental rules of Haitian politics and economics.'' He suggested that the ''dramatic poverty'' in that country was ''a function of the political system'' and ''a result of Duvalier's efforts to maintain power.''

Bias Is 'Central Issue'
The judge wrote that one ''central issue'' overshadowed all others raised by the Haitian plaintiffs, that of systematic discrimination by the service on the basis of national origin.
''The plaintiffs charged that they faced a transparent discriminatory program designed to deport Haitian nationals and no one else,'' he said. ''The uncontroverted evidence proves their claim.''
Thousands of asylum claims, the judge said, were denied before cases could be fully presented, with the subsequent violation of numerous immigration regulations and Constitutional guarantees. The abuses, he said, were ''systematic and pervasive,'' and he accused the immigration service of demonstrating ''a willingness to sacrifice due process for the sake of speed.''
''The manner in which I.N.S. treated the more than 4,000 Haitian plaintiffs violated the Constitution, the immigration statutes, international agreements, I.N.S. regulations and I.N.S. operating procedures,'' he said. ''It must stop.''

Immigration1.0-35263,JUDGE POSTPONES DECISION ON PLEA OF AFGHANS DETAINED IN CALIFORNIA,1982,2,new york times,"By WALLACE TURNER, Special to the New York Times",section 1,958.0,"At least six more weeks of indecision stretched before a group of Afghan refugees today when an administrative law judge put off hearings on their applications for political asylum.
The hearing today was on an appeal of a decision made Wednesday by David Ilchert, regional director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Mr. Ilchert, in denying the Afghans' application, said that they used tricks to get into the United States without papers on Jan. 7.
Of the 29 refugees, one turned out to have proper documents. Judge Bernard Hornback then questioned each of the others, through an interpreter, and assigned hearing dates beginning in 45 days.
David Ilchert, regional director for Immigation and Naturalization Service, delays hearings on applications by Afghan refugees for political asylum
Meantime, Mr. Ilchert has defended his decision.

Concern for 'Viability of System'
''There are hundreds of thousands of Afghanstanis around the world watching,'' Mr. Ilchert said Thursday. ''This was well orchestrated.  This is not 29 people from the same family. My feeling is that if you allow this to happen, if this package goes down, you will destroy the viability of the system, and that's why I denied the application.''
He said the group, now housed at a onetime airfield in Marin County, had arrived aboard a Japan Air Lines flight that they had boarded by using counterfeit passports and visas. Airline tickets were bought in Madras, India. He said that between Tokyo and San Francisco, the last leg of the trip, the Afghans destroyed all their travel documents.
''They were not going to have any documents on them that would help the United States to identify them and might help the United States to remove them to another country,'' Mr. Ilchert said.
''Finally, after long and arduous hours of questioning, they admitted they were from Afghanistan and made application for political refugee status. They finally broke down and told the story.''
Mr. Ilchert said that application for political asylum had been made for all of the group at New Delhi, but that their chances of getting into the United States were slim because the Middle East quota for this year was only 5,000.
''These people figured they'd never qualify as refugees,'' Mr.  Ilchert asserted. ''They thought they'd never get a number.''

Priority for Scientists
Priority is given to scientists and government officials, then to relatives of American residents.  Aid to Afghan Refugees, a group organized two years ago by former Peace Corps workers in Afghanistan, arranged for a San Francisco law firm to represent the refugees at the hearing today.
''We will be backing them,'' said John Schaecher, one of the founders of the aid group.  There are nine children and 20 adults in the group living five to a room in World War II military barracks at the airfield, where Cambodians, Laotians and Vietnamese awaiting resettlement also live.  Children of all the groups played together on swings and slides Thursday while the adult Afghans discussed their plight with reporters.
Kahin Azad, 29 years old, who said his father ran a business selling trucks and rifles in Kabul before he was killed by the Afghan Government, declared: ''If I am sent back, I will go to lie next to my father. I came here because I heard there was democracy and human rights in America.''
He said he and the others had paid $100 each in Peshawar, Pakistan, for their counterfeit travel documents. A Sunni Moslem, he said he walked out of Afghanistan wearing a turban and tribal clothing.
Mahbooba Omar, 23, who said she is seven months pregnant, said she had been a stewardess with the Afghanistani airline but was forced to quit by pressure to join the Communist Party.

'They Will Kill Us'
''If we go back to Afghanistan, first we will go to jail and second they will kill us,'' she said, with Mr. Azad interpreting.  ''They may as well take my body here,'' said Azizullah Alemzay, 27, who was a government clerk for eight years. ''It is better to die here than to be taken by Russian machine guns.''
Dr. Gollabuddin Jamal, 47, father of five children in the group, said he left his medical practice ''because our lives were in danger.''
''I didn't want my children to become Communists,'' he added.  Mr. Ilchert said: ''We'll make every effort to find a country to take them. If the only country that will take them is Afghanistan, then of course we'll permit them to remain here pending a change in the situation in Afghanistan.''

Airline Paying for Food
Meantime, until their status is clarified, Japan Air Lines pays for their food. Because they arrived on a Friday and could not get a hearing until Monday, the airline spent $6,000 keeping them in a hotel. Now they live rent free in the barracks, but their food costs about $500 a day, a spokesman for the airline said.
The refugees said they had been getting Vietnamese food, which they disliked. One night they got hamburgers from McDonald's, which they thought tasted like their traditional kebabs.
Mr. Schaecher of Aid to Afghan Refugees said he hoped the plight of this group would focus attention on ''what's happening in Afghanistan.''
''There's poison gas, and we've heard of a substance put in the dust that eats away the flesh on the feet of people who walk through the dust,'' he continued.
''The Russians are going to overcome these people by any means possible. Anybody who was outraged about Vietnam must be equally outraged about this.''

Immigration1.0-34928,JUSTICES TO WEIGH CURB ON SCHOOL FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS,1981,5,new york times,Special to the New York Times,section b,596.0,"In a key test of the constitutional rights of illegal aliens, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether Texas can refuse to provide a free public education for their children.
The case involves the constitutionality of a Texas law, enacted in 1975, that cut off state reimbursement to local school districts for the costs of educating illegal alien children. Under the law, local districts could bar the children from school or could charge them tuition, an alternative that, given the poverty of most illegal alien families, had the same effect.
Supreme Court agrees to hear case regarding constitutionality of Texas law regarding free public education for illegal aliens
The Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, on behalf of 16 children in the Tyler school district, challenged that district's imposition of a $1,000 annual fee for each illegal alien child to attend its schools. At the time of the suit, there were about 40 Mexican children in the 16,000-student district.
Both the United States District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with the children's attorneys that the Texas law violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. That clause forbids a state to ''deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.''

State Sees U.S. Responsibility
The state and the Tyler school district appealed to the Supreme Court. The case, Pyler v. Doe, No. 80-1538, has set off emotional debate throughout Texas, with state officials arguing that Texas should not be made to bear the financial burden of providing social services to those who are in the country only because of the Federal Government's failure to enforce the immigration laws.
The children's advocates argue that illegal aliens are welcome in Texas as a source of cheap labor and that many of them pay income, sales and property taxes. They cite the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit last October, in which Judge Frank M. Johnson wrote: ''Denying a person a basic education is tantamount to insuring that the person remains at the lowest socioeconomic level of modern society.''
No one appears to know how many illegal alien children of school age live in Texas. Estimates range from 20,000 to more than 100,000.  The fact that children born in this country are citizens, even if their parents are in the country illegally, complicates the task of estimating numbers. It also results in differing status for some children within the same family.

Fifth Circuit Opinion
The Supreme Court has never ruled on whether the equal protection clause applies to illegal aliens. The Fifth Circuit ruled that it does, with Judge Johnson writing that ''aliens illegally within this country are clearly persons within the jurisdiction of the state in which they reside and thus fall under the simple language of the 14th Amendment.''
In its Supreme Court appeal, the state argued that a person who is in the country illegally is technically not within a state's jurisdiction and is therefore not covered by the clause.
Because the scope of the 14th Amendment is central to the case, the Court's decision, expected sometime next year, could have a farreaching effect on the rights of illegal aliens in many contexts beyond public education.
When the case was before the Fifth Circuit last year, the Justice Department supported the children. The Reagan Administration has not yet taken a legal position in the case.

Immigration1.0-34319,"LOS ANGELES,ALMOST 200,RANKS NO.2 AMONG CITIES",1980,9,new york times,By ROBERT LINDSEY,section a,1508.0,"At the age of 199, it appears, Los Angeles has become No. 2.  This sprawling city began a yearlong bicentennial celebration this weekend that will culminate with the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of its founding by 44 immigrants from Mexico on Sept. 4, 178l.
As the civic celebration was beginning, preliminary estimates from the 1980 Census were released indicating that Los Angeles was now the nation's second most populous city, eclipsing Chicago, which had held that distinction since 1890 when it passed Philadelphia to become the ''Second City.''

Role of Mexican Immigrants
While few people dwelled on the matter, there was a pattern in the turn of events: Los Angeles, a city founded by Mexicans, appeared to have become the country's second largest city largely because of a renewed wave of immigration from Mexico.
And as it began its bicentennial year, Los Angeles appeared to be on its way to becoming the nation's first city where a majority of the population is made up of immigrants from Latin America and Asia or descendants of earlier immigrants from those regions of the world and Africa.
AN-A
This city is still the Los Angeles of freeways, movie stars, earthquakes, palm trees and smog, of experimental ways of life and unorthodox religious cults and a seemingly omnipresent, benign sun.

Autos and Real Estate
It remains perhaps the quintessential American urban expression of the automobile, a city that seems to have been experiencing a real estate boom continuously since the first land developers and hucksters came from ''back East'' a century ago and began to turn a sun-blessed semidesert into one of the world's largest metropolitan regions by importing water from mountain ranges 300 miles away.
It is the economic center of a region containing more than 10 million people that in the last decade has become the nation's major financial bridge to Asia, a visibly thriving city whose downtown is currently experiencing a rejuvenation involving more than $1 billion worth of new construction.
It is a cultural center that not only produces most of the world's movies and prime-time television programming but, increasingly, exports original plays to Broadway, has a world-class symphony orchestra whose musical director, Zubin Mehta, was recruited by the New York Philharmonic, and is the setting for a planned major museum of contemporary art that promises to be one of the most ambitious museum projects in any American city in decades.

Annual Gathering of Migrants
Every summer, a 45-year-old southern California ritual recurs, when some of the tens of thousands of migrants who moved west from Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa, Nebraska and elsewhere in the 1930's gather at picnics to talk about old times.
But each year, there are fewer people at those picnics, because some of the migrants have died and others have decided to move out of California to escape the smog and congestion.
To fill their places, there is a new wave of migrants. Los Angeles is still attracting people from other states, especially New York.  But more and more, local officials say, the newcomers are from other countries.
''It's becoming a Hispanic city,'' said Charles Drescher, director of the city's Community Analysis and Planning Division, which has estimated that the 1980 Census will show that non-Hispanic whites now make up 44 percent of the population, as against 59 percent in 1970 and 72 percent in 1960.
But he said that the changes went beyond the tide of immigrants from Mexico and other Latin-American countries who have been propelled northward by economic deprivation and have changed the look and texture of life here.
He predicted that the census would also document a sizable influx of immigrants from Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia and other thirdworld countries in the 1970's.  According to the local population researchers, it is this Latin and Asian immigration, occurring in a decade when more than one million non-Hispanic whites have left the city, that has allowed Los Angeles to challenge Chicago for the position of the country's second largest city, after New York.
Although both cities are contesting the figures as too low, the preliminary Census Bureau data indicate that Los Angeles now has about 152,000 more residents than Chicago. The figures show Los Angeles with a population of 2,878,039, about 62,000 more than in 1970, and Chicago withh a population of 2,725,295, about 644,000 fewer than in 1970.

Breakdown of Population
The city's most recent estimates indicate that whites make up 44 percent of the population; blacks, 21.5 percent; Hispanic residents 28 percent and Asians and Pacific islanders about 7 percent.
The median age of the Hispanic residents is about 19, and the rate at which they are increasing, through childbirth and immigration, has prompted some researchers to predict that Latins could account for more than half of the city's population by the end of this decade. By the year 2000, they say, the Hispanic influx could make Los Angeles the nation's largest city. Hispanic pupils already make up almost 40 percent of the student enrollment here.
The Spanish-speaking immigrants are becoming increasingly important economically here, supporting not only retailing establishments but providing the labor for a large garment industry, much of it operating in sweatshop conditions. The large Latin population is also economically vital to the city's school system, whose white population has plummeted in recent years.
The Latin residents have not yet translated their numbers into political strength, but many people say they soon will.  ''It's only a matter of time - it's already begun,'' Grace Montanez Davis, a Chicano, who is an aide to Mayor Tom Bradley, a black, said recently in an interview.

Rivalry With New York
Although this is a city with a long history of self-promotion and civic boosterism, the news that it appears to have passed Chicago in population is not likely to bring much local applause. Many people here already believe that they live in the Second City and have considered New York as their natural rival.
According to some observers, many Angelenos, as the people here call themselves, have a kind of collective municipal inferiority complex. They say this is especially true regarding New York City's image of supposedly superior cultural riches and greater economic importance, in contrast with Los Angeles's reputation as a kind of vast, shallow tinsel town - ''19 suburbs in search of a city,'' as several generations of Eastern writers have depicted it.
The differences in reputations seems especially to trouble many of the New Yorkers who have moved here. A study by the Security Pacific Bank last year indicated that about 16 percent of this region's new residents in 1979 came from New York State.
For many displaced New Yorkers, a move here results in a kind of love-hate relationship involving the two cities, and they seem to be forever debating the cities' relative merits. Many of them have been known to return to New York for quick visits to confirm their decision to move here, or to import items, ranging from Nedick's orange soda to New York pastrami, for comfort.

Neil Simon's Solution
Neil Simon, the playwright, moved here five years ago after tiring of New York's problems but now divides his time between this city and Manhattan. Recently he decided to try out his next play outside Los Angeles because of his dissatisfaction with reviews in The Los Angeles Times.
Sandy Fox, a Brooklyn-born lawyer, holds a party each year at which 100 or so former New Yorkers nostalgically play stickball and other games from their childhood.
Reflecting on the dispute over the cities' respective cultural values, Gordon Davidson, a former New Yorker who runs this city's respected Mark Taper Forum, an innovative theater organization here, said:
''I'm bored with it. It's a silly argument. There's the problem of geographic sprawl, but there is a lot of activity that's bubbling here in many areas in the performing as well as the visual arts. The cultural situation in Los Angeles is different than it is in the East. The East looked to, and benefited from, the cultural heritage of Europe, but it's also been weighed down with it. Here we can benefit from the things that occur on the Pacific rim and take advantage of our Mexican and Hispanic influence.''
The bicentennial observance will include more than 150 community projects, ranging from art shows to the commissioning of a ballet and plays that stress the city's history. Angelenos are trying to use the event to enhance the city's image. Admittedly inspired by the imagebuilding power of the ''I Love New York'' slogan, the bicentennial planners devised their own slogan: ''L.A.'s the Place.''
Margo Albert, the wife of Eddie Albert, the actor, is co-chairman of the celebration. ''This will be a fine opportunity to show that Los Angeles is a great city instead of 'tinsel town,' and all that flaky stuff,'' she said.

Immigration1.0-34303,MEXICO'S COUNT OF MIGRANTS IN U.S. IS LOWER THAN OTHERS,1980,10,new york times,"By ALAN RIDING, Special to the New York Times",section 1,958.0,"A three-year Mexican Government study of migration has calculated the number of Mexicans living illegally in the United States to be far fewer than previously estimated.
The study puts the figure at 480,000 to 1.22 million, depending on the season. This contrasts sharply with the Nixon Administration's frequent talk of six million to 12 million ''illegals'' and the Carter Administration's more cautious estimate of three million to six million.
The study, which involved four separate surveys and almost 150,000 interviews, also found that most undocumented migrants cross the United States border with the intention of returning to Mexico within a few months.
AN-A
The Mexican findings seem certain to be disputed as self-serving by the United States labor movement and other groups that maintain that illegal migrants are partly responsible for high unemployment in the United States. Some one million Mexicans were detained and returned to Mexico last year, although many were ''repeaters'' - migrants arrested several times before finally making it beyond the border region.

Earlier Estimates Disputed
United States census experts, however, have apparently endorsed the method used by the Mexican study. A United States select committee on migration, which must present policy recommendations to the Carter Administration early in January, has also taken note of the Mexican results in some of its preliminary reports.
''Earlier estimates were based either on tiny samples or on political prejudices,'' a Mexican demographer said. ''This is the first time a massive household survey has been carried out.''
After President Carter dropped his migration package, sent to Congress in August 1977 but never taken up in committee, the United States and Mexico agreed to exchange detailed studies of the migration phenomenon before analysis of a mutually acceptable policy.
But while the United States select committee concentrated on ways of preventing undocumented aliens from finding employment, such as the institution of a national labor identification card and sanctions against employers of ''illegals,'' Mexico's Labor Ministry study focused on the migrants themselves.

Interviews in Households
The first survey, in November 1977, involved the interviewing of some 10,000 Mexicans at United States-Mexican border crossings as they were returned here by the United States Border Patrol. Two similar surveys - in August 1978 and in May 1979 - covered 75,000 more Mexicans being ''voluntarily returned'' from the United States.
The principal study, however, consisted of detailed interviews in 58,000 households in scientifically selected rural and urban municipalities around the country. Information was collected on a total of 350,000 people.
Some of the results merely confirmed the findings of earlier studies. For example, more than half the Mexican migrants come from just four northern and central states - Guanajuato, Jalisco, Chihuahua and Zacatecas - while more than 50 percent head for California and some 20 percent for Texas.
Taken in December 1978 and January 1979, during a holiday season in Mexico, the household survey found only 405,000 Mexicans in the United States at the time, though analysts allowed that this was perhaps a conservative figure. The survey nevertheless confirmed the cyclical nature of the migration, particularly since only 28 percent of those absent had been away for more than a year.

Most Migrants Are Men
The overwhelming majority of migrants are men (only one in seven is a woman) and young (71 percent are between the ages of 15 and 34) although at least half the men and women are married and, as a group, leave an average of 3.29 people in Mexico dependent on their earnings in the United States.
Some United States studies have suggested that as much as $3 billion is sent or brought home by migrants each year, but the household survey questioned this figure. For those in the United States at the time of the interviews, it estimated annual remittances to Mexico of some $310 million.
One of the most interesting findings was that the migrants are not among the poorest and least educated of Mexicans. Although 78 percent come from rural areas, three out of four had a job before deciding to gamble on higher earnings north of the border.
Further, the migrants had a median education higher than the Mexican average - four years' schooling rather than the national average of 3.1 years. Some 14.4 percent had seven or more years' education. But because this fell far below the average education even of United States minorities, the Mexican analysts argued that the migrants were not competing for jobs with Americans.

Migrants Called Scapegoats
Although the final Mexican report is not due until next year, the preliminary findings hint clearly at the arguments Mexican officials will use in future negotiations on the subject with the United States.
''Illegal migrants are always used as a scapegoat when unemployment rises in the United States,'' a Mexican expert said, ''but we hope to show that there aren't as many migrants as people thought, that they generally don't want to stay in the U.S. and they don't take jobs from Americans.''
If President Carter is re-elected, the migration issue is expected to become a major topic of relation with the Unitewd States. If he is not, however, Mexicans officials are hopeful that elaboration of a new United States migration policy will be indefinitely postponed.

Jose Manuel Casanova, 50 years old, who was born in Cuba and came to the United States in 1960, confirmed that he had discussed the position with officials in the Reagan Administration, but he declined to give details. White House aides have been promising that Hispanic Americans would soon be named to several major posts.
Mr. Casanova, reached at his home, said that he was once president of the Flagship National Bank of Westland, Fla., and was now president of Agro-Com Export, which exports food and medicine to Latin America.

Gabriel Isahar Isaharov, 99-year old Russian immigrant, is granted US citizenship after being exempted from literacy requirements
So yesterday, aided by an interpreter, he pleaded his case in United States District Court in Brooklyn, arguing that he should be exempted from the literacy requirement because of his advanced age.
Unfortunately, argued Howard Baum, a Government lawyer, the law makes no such provision.  In this case, ruled Judge Henry Bramwell, it does.
''Thank you very much and God bless America,'' said Mr. Isaharov, who was promptly sworn in as a citizen.
And why had Mr. Isaharov been so determined to become a citizen?  ''Because I was born free,'' he said, ''and I want to die free as a citizen of this great country.''

In a report distributed to business leaders and news executives, Mr. Gates noted that the annual quota for immigration of Soviet Jews was recently increased to 50,000 a year and said that investigators had determined that some immigrants entering this country under the quota were not Jewish.
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates says intelligence reports indicate that Soviet Union sends ""criminals"" to US posing as Jewish emigres
''Many knowledgeable people,'' he said, ''are of the opinion that the Soviets are selecting dangerous criminals and sending them to the United States as refugees via the Jewish immigraion quota. The Soviets realize they can aggravate our already serious crime problem in this manner. Intelligence agents and spies are infiltrating in the same way.''
Mr. Gates later said at a news conference that the report was speculation but that he ''saw nothing in here so out of line it shouldn't have been stated.''

Immigration1.0-34251,RUSSIAN IMMAGRANTS ESTABLISH NEW ENCLAVES IN CITY,1980,12,new york times,By EDWARD A. GARGAN,section 1,1062.0,"When dawn breaks over Brooklyn's beaches and train after train rumbles up to the Brighton Beach elevated stop, the subway station is a bit like Moscow's Metro - fur-covered heads buried in the New Yorkbased Novoye Russkoye Slovo or Sovetsky Sport, which is published in Moscow, grandmothers knitting and bragging about their offspring.
A little later and a few blocks away, mixed in among several thousand other students, 175 Russian teen-agers, many of them wearing the latest designer jeans, enter the classrooms of Abraham Lincoln High School.
There in the Brighton Beach section, as in Manhattan's Washington Heights and Forest Hills, Queens, the morning commuters and the high school students are part of the most recent wave of Russian immigrants, nearly all of them Jews.
More than 30,000 immigrants have arrived in New York City from the Soviet Union in the last eight years, and while many older Russians retain their Slavic language and customs, nearly all the younger Russian immigrants are hurrying to adopt the manners and habits of native New Yorkers. I'll make a brand-new start of it in old
AN-A
New York. If I can make it there, I'd make it anywhere. It's up to you, New York, New York.  The band playing ''New York, New York''* one recent evening at the Golden Palace, across the causeway from Brighton Beach on Coney Island, was called the Five Russkys. But only the platters of white fish and red caviar - ''rybnoye assorti'' - and the half-empty bottles of vodka on the restaurant's tables suggested that until recently, the owners, band and patrons had been no closer to a New York nightclub than the cafes of Leningrad, Moscow or Kiev.
''Now we're Americans,'' said Vladimir Gincherman, one of three owners of the Golden Palace. Grinning at his partners over glasses of champagne, he added, ''And our children will be Americans.''
The Russian students at Abraham Lincoln, occasionally sneaking puffs on a forbidden cigarette, sit together in the school's lunchroom, speaking Russian but not fending off American culture.

Discos and Cosmetics
''We go to discos on weekends,'' said Galina Vinokurova, a junior who came from Odessa last year. Many of the Russian girls at the school stand out by their devotion to American cosmetics. Generally, the more recent a girl's arrival, the more she uses.
''It's a freedom to do what you want,'' one girl explained. ''In Russia there isn't that much makeup. It's not really considered ladylike.''
Masha Englin came to the United States with her parents in 1974, two years after the current wave of immigration from the Soviet Union began. ''I was the only Russian in Forest Hills High School the year I began,'' she said.
Students like the 23-year-old Miss Englin, now an undergraduate at Columbia University, represent the future to many Russian parents.  ''My son speaks English much better than Russian,'' said Mr.  Gincherman, who began as a truck driver six years ago. ''My job isn't to make him Russian. I want him to have a good life in America. If I stay in Brooklyn, I will put him in private schools.''
''I prepared myself to work hard,'' he added. ''Immediately we started selling things - little trinkets, things from Russia. Little by little we learned to speak English. We worked and we saved.''
Most Russians who come to New York leave the Soviet Union because they are Jewish and say they were subject to discrimination there.  But many say they are not religious and that they are not regarded as Jews by many Americans.
''We were Jewish in Russia,'' said Michael Varzar, another of the Golden Palace's owners. ''Now in America we're not Jewish, we're Russian.''
Despite Americanization, many older Russians cling to their heritage. ''Business is very good because Russians read a great deal,'' said Janny Orlikov, who runs the Russian-language Black Sea Bookstore on Brighton Beach Avenue.
She shuffled the piles of Russian-language newspapers, some from Moscow, others from New York City, on the counter before her.  ''Younger people don't read Russian books,'' she said, ''but older people, those in their 40's and 50's, certainly do. We read what we couldn't read about in Russia - about Stalin, about Khrushchev.''

A New Television Station
Early next year, Mrs. Orlikov's husband, Yuri, will help open New York's first Russian-language television station. But they both concede that the station's programming will be aimed at older Russians.
''In five or six years, Russian kids will forget Russian,'' Mrs.  Orlikov said. ''You see how even I mix English in with my Russian.'' Last year 13,000 Russians came to New York, according to Mark Handelman, an assistant director at the New York Association of New Americans. Because the Soviet Union had limited emigration, only 8,000 people had arrived here this year through Nov. 1.
Not all Russians here left the Soviet Union willingly. Pavel Litvinov says he was expelled after laboring for four years in salt mines in Siberia, the penalty he received for having demonstrated in Red Square against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Now teaching physics at the Hackley School in Tarrytown, N.Y., Mr.  Litvinov considers himself one of the few hundred exiles among the tens of thousands of immigrants.
In a gradual process, some of those Russians are beginning to leave their ethnic neighborhoods. Miss Englin's parents, Artiom and Marina, moved across Queens Boulevard to Rego Park, away from many of their compatriots.
''People would knock on our door at all hours - to taste food, to borrow sugar, to get a recipe.'' Mrs. Englin said. ''It is like that in Russia, but here we wanted some privacy.''
Mr. Gincherman, although saying that he generalizes too much about Russians in New York, added: ''We want to go to Manhattan, we want to go to shows. We want to be like everyone else.'' ---- *Copyright c 1977, United Artists Corporation. All rights administered by Unart Music Corporation.

Immigration1.0-34860,SALVADORANS HELD ON COAST AS ALIENS ASK REAGAN FOR ASYLUM,1981,7,new york times,Special to the New York Times,section a,487.0,"A group of 150 Salvadoran refugees, some of whom had been held as illegal aliens for as long as nine months, petitioned President Reagan today for political asylum.
Until Monday, 87 of the refugees had been held in several Federal detention centers in southern California. Their release came through the efforts of several religious and political organizations.
Group of Salvadoran refugees, who are being held as illegal aliens, petition President Reagan for political aylum
In addition to political asylum and an end to deportations, the refugees' petition asks for the lifting of a requirement that as much as $5,000 be posted with each application for asylum. It also asks that the Salvadorans be given United States work permits and free medical care, that asylum be granted individuals outside the United States who wish to rejoin family members here, and that American intervention in El Salvador be ended.

A Plea to 'American Conscience'
The petition, presented at a news conference here, reads in part: ''We call upon the conscience of the American people and of the United States Government to stop all Salvadoran deportations and end the bond requirement for Salvadorans with an asylum application pending. We demand an end to the inhumane treatment of undocumented persons, a violation of our civil rights and an insult against our dignity.''
Margo Cowan, executive director of El Concilio Manzo, a Tucsonbased immigrant aid group that raised $275,000 to pay the refugees' bond requirements, said: ''This group is the first Salvadoran refugee delegation to make such a dramatic appeal to the President himself.''
Robert J. Seitz, a spokesman for the western region of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said that the agency does not support a blanket political asylum policy.
''We asked the State Department for an advisory opinion on what they think could happen to the individual,'' he said. ''But we make the final decision. We think each case should be treated subjectively. All cases must rest on their individual merit.''

Refugees Greeted at Rally
The refugees, most of whom were already living in California and Arizona before being taken into custody, were welcomed with a rally and a brief Roman Catholic mass at a local restaurant after they were released Monday. Approximately 75 supporters, including some with donations of clothing, cheered as the two busloads of ''Freedom Bus Refugees'' pulled into the parking lot.
One man, identified only as Luis and speaking through an interpreter, told supporters about the murder of his family last December in El Salvador.
He said that the National Guard ''were really looking for me - they came into my house without any investigation,'' and, he said, murdered his 21-year-old wife, 1-year-old daughter, and a family guest.

Immigration1.0-34894,SMITH URGES MIAMI BUSINESSMEN AS HEAD OF IMMIGRATION SERVICE,1981,6,new york times,By ROBERT PEAR,section 1,681.0,"Attorney General William French Smith has asked President Reagan to nominate Norman Braman, a 48-year-old Miami businessman, to be Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization.
Justice Department officials said today that the choice of Mr.  Braman reflected the Administration's conclusion that management expertise was the quality most needed in the person who would direct the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Members of Congress, Government auditors and immigration attorneys had complained for years that the agency was mismanaged.
Mr. Braman started a chain of discount drug stores in Pennsylvania before moving to Florida, where he is the head of an automobile sales and leasing organization. He owns Braman Cadillac, which he has described as the largest Cadillac retail dealership in the country.
Attorney General requests nomination of Norman Braman for Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization post
Meanwhile, Justice Department officials said that President Reagan intended to replace Peter B. Bensinger, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Mr. Bensinger was appointed by President Ford in 1975 and retained by President Carter.

Budget Opposition Cited
A Reagan Administration official said that Mr. Bensinger was regarded as a poor ''team player'' because he had lobbied against budget cuts that the White House had proposed for his agency.
John H. Langer, a spokesman for the drug agency, said that Mr.  Bensinger was on a brief vacation, on a sailboat in the Chesapeake Bay, and could not be reached for comment. Mr. Bensinger had apparently not been formally notified of the President's plans to replace him.
At a meeting with reporters on May 14, Associate Attorney General Rudolph W. Giuliani sharply criticized the drug enforcement agency, saying that the Federal effort against narcotics had had ''abysmal'' results in the last four years. Attorney General Smith said recently that ''drug enforcement simply was not a priority of the previous Administration.'' However, neither Mr. Giuliani nor Mr. Smith has publicly criticized Mr. Bensinger by name.
Mr. Smith has emphasized the control of illicit drug traffic as a means of combating violent crime.

Interim Leadership Possible
Mr. Bensinger's deputy, Frederick A. Rody Jr., is scheduled to leave Washington for another assignment at the end of next week. The agency may be run by interim appointees for several months because no one has been selected to succeed either Mr. Bensinger or Mr. Rody.
The immigration service has been under the direction of temporary appointees for 20 months, since Leonel J. Castillo left office at the end of September 1979. David W. Crosland, the general counsel of the agency, served as acting commissioner until last month, when the Attorney General named Doris M. Meissner to serve in that capacity.
Mr. Braman described himself as ''the product of a good, sane immigration policy,'' noting that his mother had come from Rumania and his father from Poland.
Mr. Braman was a fund raiser for Mr. Reagan in last year's Presidential campaign. He is vice president of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation and chairman of the local United Jewish Appeal campaign.

Hearing on Haitians Postponed

Special to the New York Times
MIAMI, June 12 - A hearing to determine the legality and fairness of deportation proceedings against undocumented Haitians was postponed today by a United States District Court judge here.
Judge Alcee Hastings instructed the Immigration and Naturalization Service to make transcripts of its June 1-5 Miami deportation hearings at which 76 Haitians were ordered deported to their country. He indicated he might begin taking testimony next Wednesday.
The judge ruled on a petition filed on behalf of the Haitians by the Haitian Refugee Center Inc. and the American Civil Liberties Union. The disposition of the case could affect more than 6,000 Haitians who might be deported as undocumented aliens.

Immigration1.0-34354,SMUGGLERS FIND ALIENS AS VALUABLE AS DRUGS ALONG MEXICAN BORDER,1980,7,new york times,"By JOHN M. CREWDSON, Special to the New York Times",section a,2824.0,"''Thirty-eight thousand dollars for a week's work,'' John Rockhill said, leaning against the fender of his limegreen cruiser. ''You can't make that much running dope. What fascinates me about alien smuggling is the money involved.''
Mr. Rockhill, who sports the deep copper tan of the veteran United States Border Patrol agent, was talking about the ring of smugglers who, for $1,200 a head, brought about 30 Salvadoran citizens across the border into the sunbaked Arizona desert two weeks ago and left them there without water. Twelve of the Salvadorans and a man believed to be one of their smugglers perished in the infernal heat; Mr. Rockhill was among the officers who discovered their parched bodies and rescued their companions, who were nearly dead.
But thousands of Mexicans and Central and South Americans are successfully smuggled into this country each day by hundreds of rings trafficking in human contraband.
AN-A
As nations to the south continue to suffer economic and political troubles, refuge in the United States is becoming one of the most valuable commodities in the world, and the citizens of such countries, foremost among them El Salvador, are increasingly willing to pay what for them are huge sums of money in return for the opportunity to live and work in this country.
More and more, officials say, illegal aliens who once risked walking across the border on their own are turning to smugglers for help with their illicit journeys.
It is common in Ciudad Juarez, across the Rio Grande from here, to see smugglers, who call themselves ''coyotes,'' negotiating deals for the transport of groups of aliens, whom they refer to as ''pollos,'' or ''chickens.'' The aliens are bought and sold like shares of stock on an exchange. Preceded by spotters in radio-equipped ''scout cars,'' convoys of beer trucks, motor homes, moving vans, horse trailers and vehicles of every description set out from the border each night, most filled to overflowing with aliens who have paid the standard tariffs in advance -$300 for delivery to Denver, $500 to Chicago, $750 or more to Detroit or New York City. Prices from Central and South America are higher still.

A Growing 'Industry'
In 1975 the Immigration and Naturalization Service apprehended 76,000 smuggled aliens; last year it caught 211,000, but officials estimate that two to five times that number may have escaped detection.
As a result of such rapid growth, the organized smuggling of aliens has become what one Federal investigator called ''a major industry'' along both sides of the 2,000-mile Mexican-United States border.
Over the last five years, investigators say, the traffic in smuggled aliens has more than tripled, and it is now so lucrative that it rivals the smuggling of narcotics in profitability.
A big, well-organized ring, and there are a half-dozen of them in the El Paso area alone, can move 500 aliens a week. At $500 each, that is a quarter of a million dollars a week, $12 million a year.  Some narcotics syndicates are now branching out, or switching entirely, to the smuggling of illegal aliens, where the financial rewards are more certain and the possibility of stiff jail terms far less.
Some rings specialize, supplying only prostitutes, for example, or restaurant waiters. Investigators say that at least one organized crime organization has lately entered the business, and the immense potential profits have even attracted some more improbable individuals.

Marine Wives Convicted
Last year, for example, a group of wives of marines stationed at Camp Pendleton, Calif., were convicted of transporting Mexican aliens from Tijuana to Los Angeles, having taken them through the marine base to avoid the Border Patrol's checkpoint on Interstate 5 at San Clemente.
An American customs officer and an air traffic controller from San Diego are currently in the Tijuana jail, accused of having worked together to fly illegal aliens across the border in a Government airplane. And a Roman Catholic priest in Texas was found to have been supplying false identity cards to smuggled aliens.
The priest, one official said, ''was looking at it as a humanitarian thing.'' But officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, whose 250 antismuggling agents are struggling against budgetary and investigative restrictions to slow the inward flow, uniformly reject any suggestion that the smugglers' crime is a victimless one, a humanitarian service to those who, without their assistance, might meet the fate of the Salvadorans in the forbidding badlands of the desert.

The Aliens are the Victims
''There's no such thing as a good smuggler,'' said E.J. Scott, chief of the tiny Border Patrol station at Why, Ariz., near where the Salvadorans died. Other officials agree.
The smuggled aliens, they say, are the ultimate victims, treated with a callous disregard for their well-being and safety, held for long periods in vile, windowless ''drop houses'' along the border that are often no more than shacks, and then loaded with little food or water into trucks so crowded that there is no room to lie down, or even to sit. In Houston last April, a beer truck stopped by the police for a traffic violation was found to have 55 aliens inside.  The aliens said they had been without food or water for two days.
Should anything go amiss on the trip, the officials say, the smugglers' first concern is almost always for themselves. Aliens injured in highway accidents are frequently left by the roadside, as happened last October at Truth or Consequences, N.M. In another instance two years ago, two aliens locked in the trunk of a car burned to death when the car caught fire and the smugglers fled, and even the recent incident involving the Salvadorans was not the first of its kind. The bodies of eight aliens were found in the desert near Yuma, Ariz., last year, apparently left there by smugglers to die of thirst.
The smugglers nearly always surrender peacefully when they are apprehended, but on occasion they try to evade their pursuers, sometimes with tragic consequences. Last April, a pickup truck carrying 14 illegal aliens near Laredo, Tex., tried to outrun two Border Patrol agents and two local sheriff's deputies. In the chase, shots were fired at the truck and a 6-year-old girl, an illegal alien, was killed. The two deputies later said they had seen one of the border patrolmen point a shotgun at the truck and heard a report. A Federal grand jury is investigating the matter.

'An Inhumane Situation'
Such incidents are not confined to the border. Earlier this year a boat captain was convicted of manslaughter in Palm Beach, Fla., after he attempted to evade arrest on smuggling charges by throwing a Haitian woman and her five children into the sea. All drowned. ''It's just such an inhumane situation,'' said Elizabeth Rogers, an Assistant United States Attorney here.
Though most of the aliens pay for their passage in advance, officials say, they are sometimes held captive by smugglers until friends or relatives can come up with more money than was agreed upon. Even after arriving at their destinations, they are often forced to pay rent to the smugglers and even told where to shop for food or clothing.
In instances where the owner of a business or factory has paid their transportation, the aliens are held for weeks or months in a kind of economic bondage, forced to work for reduced wages until their employer has been repaid. Sometimes the bondage is real. Last November, Connie Ray Alford, a Truxno, La., chicken farmer, was convicted of peonage after it was discovered that nine Mexican aliens smuggled to his farm from Kerrville, Tex., had been kept chained by their necks until they had worked off the price of their passage.
For those aliens known to the Border Patrol as ''OTM,'' or ''other than Mexican,'' the first contact with a smuggler usually comes in the homeland they are preparing to flee, and the contacts are not difficult to make. Uncounted bogus ''travel agencies'' that put together consignments of illegal entrants exist in Mexico, Central and South America, and they are easy to find. A recent issue of La Prensa Grafica, published in San Salvador, carried an obvious classified advertisement. ''Passengers to Tijuana and Los Angeles,'' it read, ''telephone 25-0643.''
Although some smuggling rings are recognizing the advantages of the largely unguarded Canadian border as a point of illegal entry - the aliens, officials say, are first flown to Montreal - most of the illegal immigrants still pass through Mexico on their journey to the north.

The Staging Areas
The Mexican Government allows residents of Central and South America to enter as tourists, but it gives them visas that prohibit travel farther north than Mexico City. The restriction is easily circumvented, however. The Salvadorans who died in Arizona had such visas in their passports.
After the aliens reach cities along the Mexican side of the border, preparations are made to bring them across.  The staging areas are big cities and little towns alike, from giant Tijuana, south of San Diego, to tiny Sonoita, south of Arizona.  Almost any day, a visitor to Ciudad Juarez can see the smugglers gathering in the Plaza Monumental to put together their deals.
''They're like peddlers going around,'' said Robert L. Barber, who heads the Border Patrol's antismuggling unit here. ''You can see negotiations being made all over the place.'' While the ''coyotes'' deal, the ''chickens'' wait, crammed a dozen to a room in cheap, shabby hotels like the Balcones, a favorite with Salvadorans.
After a group is assembled it is led by a coyote, after dark, across the shallow Rio Grande a few miles outside of town. More often than not the crossing is successful, but even if they are captured the aliens are simply returned to Mexico, free to try again the next night. Some smuggling rings give ''guarantees'' - a second crossing for free if the first one fails. ''It gets them business,'' said Mr.  Barber. Other rings try to attract clients by offering false documentation as part of their service, for example birth certificates, Social Security cards, drivers' licenses -whatever is needed to live and work in the United States.
Assistance from a smuggler is not necessary for crossing the river here. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Mexican aliens slip into El Paso each morning on their own to work and then return to their families in Juarez at night. When the aliens hire a smuggler, Mr.  Barber says, ''They're really paying to get away from the border'' since travel beyond the border is ''very difficult for someone unfamiliar with our country.'' And aliens who choose to cross at less heavily patrolled but harsher parts of the border, into Arizona, New Mexico and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, are far more in need of experienced guides.

Hiding Points
Once safely across, the aliens are hidden in one of the ''wetback motels'' that dot El Paso and the San Diego area, or in private houses rented by the smugglers. The indictment here last month of 14 people charged with operating a medium-sized smuggling ring that took in an estimated $1 million a year identified an apartment on San Jose Road as the ring's ''drop house.''
Most of the 14 members of that ring are related to one another, a common characteristic of such groups and one that makes it difficult for Federal immigration agents to penetrate their operations. Agents sometimes pose as aliens waiting to be smuggled into the United States, but most of their intelligence comes from paid informants, such as hotel clerks and taxi drivers, on both sides of the border.
While the trip northward is being arranged, the agents are content to wait. ''We don't want to get aliens in a hotel,'' Mr. Barber said. ''We want to get the smuggler who's going up the road with them.''
The Immigration and Naturalization Service tries to catch smugglers with their ''loads'' in a variety of ways, not all of them successful. The Border Patrol maintains checkpoints, for example, on most major highways near the border, and suspicious vehicles are stopped and searched. But the checkpoints do not always operate, because of bad weather or a shortage of agents, and the smugglers keep a close watch for those times when they are ''down.''
Another technique involves the use of the Border Patrol's authority, which it acquired last year, to seize vehicles used to transport aliens. William Selzer, the deputy Border Patrol chief in Chula Vista, Calif., south of San Diego, said he believed the impoundments were beginning to slow the alien smuggling traffic in his area.
But if the traffic is slowing, it is still substantial. In the first two weeks of this month, 114 smugglers and 586 smuggled aliens were apprehended in the San Diego area.

By Rented Vehicle or by Train
Bert Marino, who heads the Border Patrol's smuggling unit in Washington, said he suspected that the smugglers, rather than risking their own vehicles, would now begin renting trucks, and at least one ring in the El Paso area that specializes in smuggling Salvadorans has begun buying its clients train tickets to Los Angeles.
The loss of an aging truck or two is a small price for an organization involved in such a lucrative business, even for an average-sized ring that might take in $1 million or $2 million a year. Many rings are far more profitable. Last year the authorities broke up a ring in the area that they said had grossed between $10 million and $25 million a year, and several investigators recalled that the leader of a group of Mexican women known as ''the blondes'' that operated in the San Diego area had forfeited her bail of $250,000.
''The big operations make just as much as the drug smugglers,'' said Mr. Marino, who spent 11 years with the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration before coming to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ''There are hundreds of rings making money off of this, and there are scores of them making big, big money.''
Mr. Selzer, the deputy Border Patrol chief, estimated that a quarter of the active narcotics rings in his area were now also smuggling aliens, or ''co-mingling the loads'' as he put it.
The financial attractions of alien smuggling are many.  For one thing, smuggling fees are paid in advance and even if the aliens are arrested the smugglers have their money in hand. The smugglers of narcotics must first purchase the drugs, and a profit cannot be realized until the drugs have entered the country and been sold to a distributor.
In addition, most courts have treated alien smugglers, especially first offenders, far more leniently than drug smugglers. ''We get a lot of probated sentences,'' Mr. Barber said. Mr. Marino added that sentences average only 19 months in felony alien smuggling cases, for which the maximum penalty is five years in prison. ''That leaves a lot to be desired,'' he said.
More smugglers are being arrested than ever before. Last year, some 18,500 smugglers, employed by about 300 rings, were apprehended, compared with 15,000 three years ago. About 6,000 of them were prosecuted, and about 2,000 ultimately convicted.
But the impact on the alien traffic is far from clear.  Investigators say that those who are caught and convicted are largely lower- and middle-level operatives, guides, drivers, ''arrangers'' and those who run the drop houses. In many instances the leaders of the rings, who may live abroad, seem beyond grasp. Many of the rings have their headquarters in Mexico and, while the Mexican immigration authorities have provided some cooperation in tracking smugglers down, their efforts have been sporadic and directed mainly at the smuggling of non-Mexicans through their country.
''The people they catch are not the people who are making the money off these deals,'' said Terry Amdur, a Los Angeles lawyer who has defended a number of accused alien smugglers. Those who run the rings may be sophisticated criminals -''They're getting more sophisticated all the time,'' Mr. Marino said - but the coyotes who work for them fit a far different description: young men in their early 20's, most of them Mexicans who have been to the United States to work illegally and who have found that they can use their knowledge of the country and its customs to make far more money than a menial job will provide.
''They don't seem to be bad people,'' Mr. Amdur said. But Mr.  Barber disagreed, recalling that he once seized a truck in Chicago in which aliens had been stashed with only a sand-filled tin can for a toilet and scant food to sustain them on their long journey from the Texas border, ''a few pounds of bologna, a loaf of bread, a few jugs of water.''
Mr. Marino agreed: ''It's a human tragedy we're dealing with, the individual who got to Chicago with his fingers frozen because he was left in a truck for 30 hours.''

Immigration1.0-34336,SOME IMMIGRATION AIDES STAY HOME TO PROTEST RELEASE,1980,8,new york times,By JOYCE PURNICK,section a,613.0,"A number of United States immigration officers failed to turn up for work at their Manhattan office yesterday in a loosely organized protest against the release of Iranian demonstrators Tuesday.
Up to a third of the 187 investigators at the district office at 26 Federal Plaza joined what was termed an illegal work stoppage by a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The protest, which some officers called a sickout, grew out of the release of 171 Iranian men arrested in Washington last week and transferred to a Federal prison in Otisville, 70 miles northwest of New York City in Orange County. Twenty Iranian women, held in a Manhattan facility, were also freed Tuesday.
AN-A
Several immigration officials who worked on the case in Otisville have charged that many of the Iranians were freed prematurely, before their legal status - or even names - could be verified.
The last of the Iranians left a mosque in Woodside, Queens, early yesterday after neighborhood residents staged an angry demonstration against them. The 70 to 80 remaining had rejected Mayor Koch's offer of safe passage, choosing to leave for Washington in vans provided by the American Indian movement.
All were arrested July 27 at a Washington demonstration in support of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. After being detained in a Washington jail until Friday, they were transferred to the Federal facilities in upstate New York and held for four days on suspicion that they had violated immigration laws.
Some of the 17 immigration officers charged with investigating the Iranians in Otisville say they were not permitted to finish background checks and allege that the decision to release them was politically motivated. ''The processing was not even completed,'' said Ignatius A. Gentile, an official with the American Federation of Government Employees. ''If the Administration feels we have to turn these people loose and out of custody of the Immigration Service, why doesn't the Government just state the truth? That's what's upsetting my people.''
Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said in Washington that the officers' criticism ''does not excuse what they have done.'' All those who stayed away from their jobs have been sent telegrams notifying them that unless they provide medical certification confirming that they were ill, they will face disciplinary action. ''That could range from a simple letter of admonishment to loss of a job,'' Mr. Jervis said.
However, Jack Solerwitz, lawyer for the officers' union, said that according to the rules, an immigration officer would have to be ill for three days before a medical note would be required.  He said the absenteeism yesterday was caused by illness, not a sickout. ''That would be illegal,'' he added.
The decision to release the Iranians, Mr. Jervis explained, ''was made after their identifications were established to our satisfaction.'' He added that ''their release was based upon review of available records.''
One officer who worked in Otisville said in an interview yesterday that the Iranians did not have identification and that the Immigration Service did not telephone many of the schools where they said they were enrolled.
Mr. Jervis confirmed that some of the schools were not called and that the Iranians did not carry identification. ''We released them because there was no reason to hold them any longer,'' he said.  ''They had satisified our requirements about providing information about themselves. But we're continuing to gather information on them. You can be legal today and illegal tomorrow. Releasing them does not preclude any action later.''

Immigration1.0-34302,TEXAS SCHOOL DISTRICT BARS CHILDREN OF ILLEGAL ALIENS,1980,10,new york times,UPI,section a,339.0,"School officials began turning away children of illegal aliens today who tried to enroll in classes in the overcrowded Brownsville school district.
Federal District Judge Filemon Vela of Brownsville granted a temporary injunction Friday, and a hearing is scheduled for Oct. 21 to decide if a permanent injunction to stop the flow of alien children will be granted.
A deputy United States Marshal served the order on the first person who tried to enroll a child of an illegal alien as a student, and school attendance officers were given copies of the order to show to other people who brought their children to enroll. According to school officials, many of the parents said that they would consult lawyers to see what recourse was available.
AN-A
The 557 children of illegal aliens already attending Brownsville's 33 public schools apparently are not affected by the temporary order.  ''We are not going to try to kick anybody out,'' said Tony Martinez, an attorney for the school district.

School Uses Court Option
Justice Lewis Powell of the United States Supreme Court refused Brownsville's request Oct. 2 for an exception to an earlier ruling that required Texas schools to enroll children of illegal aliens.
But in turning down the request, the first made by a Texas school district, Justice Powell had indicated the district was free to apply to ''an appropriate district court'' for relief.
In his petition to the district court, Mr. Martinez contended that the flow of illegal aliens would render the district ''unable to provide the standard of education which it considers proper.''
By last Thursday 27,120 children were enrolled in the district. The district has anticipated 26,000 pupils when the its budget was prepared last summer.
The school district said in its petition that permitting illegal alien children into the schools would require the purchase of additional temporary facilities.

Immigration1.0-35210,The Nation in Summary; A Look Into Haitian Camps,1982,5,new york times,"By Michael Wright, William C. Rhoden and Caroline Rand Herron",section 4,252.0,"Apparently weary of fending off charges of concentration-camp conditions, the Reagan Administration last week agreed to let an international body examine facilities at two detention centers for Haitian refugees.
The visits were requested by a unit of the Organization of American States, in response to complaints at Fort Allen in Puerto Rico and the Krome North camp near Miami.
President Reagan agrees to allow international body examine facilities at two detention centers for Haitian refugeesThe immigration and Naturalization Service said 555 Haitians were being held at Krome North and 771 at Fort Allen. Nationwide some 2,025 Haitians are being held at centers in 14 cites.
Washington had opposed an investigation on the ground that Haitians had not exhausted all available remedies in Federal courts. When the commission decided to visit anyway, the United States authorities agreed to cooperate.
Last May the immigration service began detaining Haitians caught illegally entering the country instead of releasing them to American sponsors. In October the Administration ordered interdictions at sea to stop Haitians before they arrived; at the same time the immigration service began holding rapid deportation hearings.
A Miami judge's subsequent ruling that no Haitain could be tried unless represented by legal counsel had the effect of stopping the trials but prolonging the Haitians' detention. The United States insists that the Haitians are economic refugees, while the Haitains insist they are seeking political asylum.

Immigration1.0-35245,The Nation; An Immigration Proposal That Gets Somewhere,1982,3,new york times,By Michael Wright and Caroline Rand Herron,section 4,251.0,"President Ford, President Carter and the 96th Congress all studied immigration policy. So did President Reagan who, like Mr. Carter, issued legislative proposals.
Immigration reform bill is introduced in CongressLast week, the 97th Congress went further, producing an actual reform bill.
The measure, introduced in the Senate by Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and in the House by Romano L. Mazzoli, a Kentucky Democrat, would offer permanent resident status to those who entered the country illegally before 1978 and temporary status, which could be upgraded after two years, to those who entered before 1980.  Those arriving after that, Mr. Mazzoli said, ''would have to go back home.'' The Reagan Administration had proposed a 10-year waiting period, which critics said would be too long to be effective.
The Simpson-Mazzoli bill would come down harder on employers who knowingly hired illegal workers than the Administration, subjecting those with even a single illegal employee to fines of up to $2,000 and six-month prison terms. Mr. Reagan had sought to limit comparable sanctions to employers with four or more illegal workers.  The bill would also require the President to develop a ''universal employment authorization'' system to determine a worker's eligibility, something Mr. Reagan opposes. Instead of the President's guest-worker program, it would ''streamline'' existing programs admitting laborers from Mexico, Jamaica and other countries.

Immigration1.0-34355,THE SPARSE WATCH ON AMERICA'S BORDERS 4/bl; by Hamilton Fish Jr.,1980,7,new york times,,section 1,433.0,"To the Editor:
The smuggling of aliens which prompted your July 7 article on our undermanned Border Patrol is the vilest and most frustrating aspect of illegal migration.
he U.S. Border Patrol is charged with maintaining the integrity of our borders between points of entry. Numbering only 350 at any given time on our 2,000-mile border with Mexico, it is no match for the smugglers, who are well-organized on both sides of the border.
AN-A
Illegal border crossings increase annually; in 1979, apprehensions exceeded one million. While it is more humane to turn aliens back at the border than to apprehend them in the interior of the country, reassigning personnel while failing to increase levels makes the mission of the Border Patrol virtually impossible. More officers are needed, particularly since South Florida is now an area of vulnerability.
The President's policy statement of August 1977 calling for improved border control has been followed up by reductions in patrol strength. Personnel on duty in May 1980 was 214 below levels authorized by the Congress in fiscal 1978.
Congressional concern was expressed on July 1, when the House adopted, 337 to 72, my amendment to provide for 311 additional Border Patrol positions in Justice Department appropriations for fiscal year 1981.
As long as Mexico and other Central American countries experience rapid population growth, poverty and high unemployment, pressures on our border will continue. Cooperative arrangements with Mexico to develop labor-intensive industry and agriculture would help.  Likewise, the magnet effect of the U.S. economy could be reduced by economic disincentives.
All aspects of this complex phenomenon, including the status of aliens already here illegally, are being explored by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy. Its recommendations, due in March of 1981, will certainly include more effective control of our borders.
Recognizing the magnitude and importance of the problem, recruitment and training of Border Patrol personnel should not be delayed.  (Rep.) HAMILTON FISH JR.  Washington, July 11, 1980
The writer is ranking member on the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law and a member of the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy.

Immigration1.0-34939,The Talk of Virgin Islands; GROWTH BRINGS PROBLEMS TO VIRGIN ISLANDS AS IMMIGRATION PUTS A STRAIN ON SERVICES,1981,4,new york times,"By JO THOMAS, Special to the New York Times",section 1,1028.0,"The water pipes, recalcitrant on the golf greens and nearly always dry in the housing projects, had been coughing air downtown for six days. Ann Johnson, proprietor of The Snack Box, a local lunch counter, apologized for the paper plates and cups.
''We've had a water emergency since December 1976,'' she said. ''We got the garbage emergency in January 1979; they cut off the downtown pickups. We have power emergencies and the road emergency, and then we have the school emergency. The only emergency we don't have is on sunshine.''
Growth brings problems to Virgin Islands as immigrations puts a strain
She stood, flushing pink in the heat, watching the hamburgers on the propane grill. ''I've been mugged, hit over the head with a gun, and every member of my family has been robbed. And groceries,'' she sighed. ''We used to say that no matter what you bought, it was $10 a sack. Now it's $30. The price of food is higher than it is in Washington, D.C.''
The Johnsons came to St. Thomas from the mainland 18 years ago, but now they are thinking of going back. ''We have the feeling we're not wanted,'' Mrs. Johnson said.
When the jet plane opened the Virgin Islands, a United States territory, to large-scale tourism in the 1960's, and to large-scale industrial development, the Johnsons were only two in a torrent of outsiders who flooded into the islands to share in the boom. There were merchants, construction workers, hotel workers and refinery workers. Some, like the Johnsons, black as well as white, came from the states because they were looking for a tropical way of life.  Others, mostly black, came from the desperately poor islands of the Eastern Caribbean, looking only for a few dollars to send home.
As the population tripled, to 95,214 from 32,000 from 1960 to 1980, the school enrollment quadrupled. The number of telephones rose to 41,174, from 3,905, and the number of cars grew to 37,889, from 4,264.
The electrical system, one of the costliest under the American flag, became overburdened and produced rotating power failures. Rain used to provide the water supply; now sources include desalination plants and water barged in from Puerto Rico. It is not enough.
Little of this affects the tourists, who numbered about 56,000 cruise ship passengers in 1960 but increased by 1980 to well over a million visitors stopping to spend a few hours in the bustling dutyfree shops around the islands' beaches.
The growth and the crowding has put severe strains on the islands' services and on its psyche.  ''When you have Robinson Crusoe alone on an island, you have no problem,'' said Otis L. Felix, the Police Commissioner, a veteran of 26 years on the force.
When the population was smaller, he said, Virgin Islanders ''were neighborly people, where I was your keeper and you were my people.'' He added, ''People had a respect for law and order.'' Now Commissioner Felix has trouble getting cooperation from witnesses.And last December, for the first time in history, a policeman was attacked and killed while on a routine patrol.
After that shooting, a Federal court determined, the police beat a confession out of a suspect, Juan Francis, a member of the Rastafarian sect, and the Rastas taunted the funeral cortege.
The problem, Virgin Islanders say, is knowing just who the community is these days. ''It's newcomers talking to newcomers,'' said Leslie Reovan, a sociologist at the College of the Virgin Islands. Natives of the islands, although they are the largest group, are outnumbered in their own land by the rich ''continentals'' from the mainland, who are driving up the price of real estate, and the poor ''aliens'' from the Caribbean, who want jobs, homes, schools and medical care.
Last fall, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools notified the territory that Charlotte Amalie High School in St.  Thomas and Central High School in St. Croix were in danger of losing their accreditation because of staff shortages, lack of supplies, termite damage, poor maintenance and poor attendance.
''We really need help,'' said Mrs. Enez Harvey, an aide to the Superintendent of Schools. ''We really need some understanding.'' So many children are flowing into the schools from the Eastern Caribbean, including Haitians this year, that the school system conducts registration three times a year, she said.
As outsiders migrate to the islands, many young people leave to find jobs and opportunity. A high percentage enlists in the armed forces.
''The tragedy of the Virgin Islands is loss of its nationals, the youths who go away and don't come back,'' said Mr. Reovan. ''It's this drifting situation that leads to a society's having no center and no future, and we keep incorporating more and more of the irrelevancies of continental politics into this place.''
A particularly cruel ''irrelevancy'' has been the importation of American-style racism to islands in which native blacks tended to feel superior to the poorly educated white French immigrants.
Racial slurs that white Americans have applied to blacks are now used by blacks here to refer to the many American whites who have come from the Southern states since 1960 to work in the giant Hess Oil refinery on St. Croix. It is a self-contained community that mixes little, if at all, with the local population, and blacks here are not at all impressed.
''They come from Texas, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida,'' said Leona Watson, a black community activist in St. Croix who has been critical of Mr. Hess's operations. ''They can't read or write, but they come down as bosses.''
''They can't deal with a black person who is highly educated,'' she said, ''but the shoe's on the other foot now. They're on our ground now.
''Last week, one of them said to seven or eight of our boys, 'I feel like getting a machine gun and mowing you all down,' and those were the most dangerous boys he could ever mess with. I told them to mark his face well and don't make someone else pay for his mistake.''
She is equally upset about the black aliens who now have permanent resident status. ''They're interested only in the U.S. dollar, not the land. They have their own homeland. They've improved their country. We have nowhere to run.''

Immigration1.0-34932,The Unluckiest Cubans,1981,5,new york times,,section 1,393.0,"The story sounds like Dickens, rewritten by Kafka and updated by Joseph Heller:
The exhausted Cuban refugee confronts a stern immigration official who asks, ''Have you ever been in prison?'' He has, briefly, for a bit of black marketeering frowned upon by Fidel Castro. In Cuba he would lie about it, but this is America. So he tells the truth, and is hustled off to a penitentiary. He is ''excludable.''
Editorial comment criticizes government's policy concerning jailing of ""Excludable"" Cuban refugees
Eventually he gets a hearing, but it doesn't go well. He lacks court records and witnesses, yet the burden is on him to prove that he is not a dangerous criminal. As it sinks in that he might remain locked up indefinitely, he wonders if it wouldn't be better to return to Cuba, to take his chances. But the Cubans won't hear of it.
Finally outrage takes over. What about the wonderful American Constitution? Ah, that only applies to people who are in America.  Because he is ''excludable,'' at least legally, he is not yet ''in'' America.
But of course this K. and 1,800 other Cuban emigres who are being held as excludables are most decidedly in America. Some have serious criminal records and would pose a danger if set free. But many appear to have only slightly blemished records. No one knows for sure. The immigration laws, however, do not entitle them to the presumption of innocence, and so the doubt works against them. The situation so disturbed a Federal judge in Kansas that he ordered the release of a 48-year-old Cuban inmate in whom he recognized no ''threat to public safety.'' The man remains in prison pending appeal.
The Carter Administration undertook a two-part program for dealing with such Cuban prisoners. It proposed a review panel that would assess each case and release those judged not dangerous. At the same time, it started quiet negotiations with Cuba to arrange the return of truly ''undesirable'' criminals. Before any deal could be nailed down, Ronald Reagan assumed office and suspended the talks until there had been a wider review of refugee and immigration policy.
May that review, soon to be completed, give these unluckiest Cubans some reason for hope. When there is little recourse in law, a year is too long to spend in a maximum-security prison - for administrative reasons.

Immigration1.0-34995,To Turn the Illegal Tide,1981,1,new york times,,section 4,601.0,"At last, the country seems to be getting somewhere in the tormenting effort to reduce illegal immigration.
To some people, the numbers are so alarming they are ready to close the Golden Door with a slam. Others, for whom immigration means infusions of energy, resist closing it at all, even to illegal migrants. Still others, and we count ourselves among them, advocate keeping the Golden Door open - while shutting the back door.
Editorial discusses problem of illegal aliens in US following vote by Federal commission on immigration recommending alien identification cards
Whatever one's view, the debate so far has been sterile. How can one seriously argue whether to increase legal immigration by 80,000 or 250,000 when maybe 6 million illegal aliens are already here and thousands more are coming daily? There can be no sensible policy without the means to enforce it.
The good news is that last week, after 19 months of work, a blueribbon Federal commission took two final votes that, taken together, will vitalize the debate. If Congress goes along, a humane and consistent immigration policy will not be far behind.
In the first, more important decision, the Select Commission on Immigration voted 14 to 2 for something called employer sanctions.  It was, in simpler language, a resounding vote against hypocrisy.
At present, the United States says to the Immigration Service: patrol the border, conduct sweeping raids - keep the illegals out.  But the message to employers is a big wink: even if we catch illegals working for you, they're culpable, not you. So the economic magnet continues to draw thousands. The Border Patrol, understaffed by budget-cutters and undermined by employers, is dispirited, and small wonder. If Congress now in fact makes employers culpable for hiring illegal aliens, that alone would be a strong deterrent.
The second commission vote, concerning the emotional question of identification, was disappointing.  Employers cannot be held accountable if they can't readily tell which aliens are illegal. Since forged papers are cheap, the answer is some form of secure identification. One proposal is to require job applicants to identify themselves with several pieces of I.D. and to swear that they are legal residents. Another idea is a call-in data bank, permitting employers to check an applicant's truthfulness, the way retail clerks verify credit-card purchases.
The most effective method would probably be forgery-proof Social Security cards. That arouses fears of internal passports and police statism. But all workers must now supply their number when they start a job, or a bank account; it's hard to see what freedom is at issue, beyond the freedom to give a false number.
Which method did the commission choose? None; it ducked. By the narrowest imaginable vote, 8 to 7 with one pass, it voted for some kind of more secure identification without specifying. Commissions are meant to lead opinion and absorb criticism. That hair-thin vote is not likely to inspire Congressional courage.
Two things have been missing from the debate.  First, technical information; for years, people in Congress have been saying, yessir, we need to clean up the immigration mess, but it's complicated and needs further study. The Select Commission has provided that study and nullified that excuse. What has been missing, second, is the will to enforce sound immigration rules once they're in place. The commission has expressed that will. The rest is up to Congress.

Dinora and Carlos Palomino and their 7-year-old son, Enarxis, were flown to San Jose, Costa Rica, yesterday.  They were among 10 Cubans who arrived in Miami illegally last February. An judge from the Immigration and Naturalization Service signed deportation papers against the group two weeks ago, but the seven others have not been sent back.
The family's attorney, Mark J. Newman, obtained a five-minute emergency hearing with Federal District Judge Edward Davis just before the three boarded the plane, but he refused to stop the deportation.
They were seeking political asylum, but Judge Moseley said that was not the issue, observing, ''Costa Rica is not Cuba.''

Immigration1.0-34902,U.S. EXPECTING TALKS TO STRENGTHEN TIES WITH MEXICO,1981,6,new york times,"By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to the New York Times",section a,656.0,"The Reagan Administration hopes that the two days of talks with President Jose Lopez Portillo of Mexico will strengthen communications between the United States and Mexico at a time when several issues have been causing strains between the two countries.
On his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base this evening, Mr. Lopez Portillo was greeted by Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. and then traveled to Blair House in downtown Washington. He was scheduled to arrive at the White House tomorrow morning for a brief greeting ceremony and then leave for the Presidential retreat at Camp David.
Administration officials said that among the principal items on the agenda of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Lopez Portillo would be trade, immigration and differing views of security problems in Central America.
Reagan Administration hopes talks with President Lopez Portillo in Washington will strengthen ties with Mexico'Guest Workers' Proposed
To deal with the problems posed by the illegal entry of Mexicans into the United States, the Reagan Administration has been shaping a policy to double the annual limit on legal immigration from Mexico and to establish an experimental ''guest worker'' program that would permit 50,000 Mexicans a year to enter the United States to seek employment.
Mexico has long pressed the United States to be more open to Mexicans seeking job opportunities. In addition, Mexican officials are known to feel that any ''guest worker'' program should probably permit more than 50,000 Mexicans to enter each year.
On trade, the United States has been eager to discuss its concerns about the array of Mexican tax measures and other supports aimed at increasing Mexican exports, particularly farm products that compete with American products.
Perhaps the greatest point of contention between the two Presidents is expected to center on the Reagan Administration's new policies in Central America and the Caribbean. President Reagan has approved, but not announced, a sweeping new policy of economic and military assistance to ease poverty and counter what the Administration maintains is Soviet and Cuban intervention in the area. The President has already authorized limited military assistance to El Salvador to help the Government there oppose leftist insurgents.
President Lopez Portillo opposes the Salvadoran Government and has had friendly relations with both Cuba and the revolutionary Government of Nicaragua, a regime the Reagan Administration has criticized.

Joint Statement Not Planned
In a briefing for reporters, a senior Administration official said there would not be a joint statement at the end of the talks or any effort to ''align'' or ''adjust'' differing views, as there have been in some of Mr. Reagan's previous talks with world leaders.
''It is not our position to have President Lopez Portillo leave this meeting with a clear-cut understanding on every issue that has arisen, or will arise between the United States and Mexico,'' the official said.
The two men first met in 1979 while Mr. Reagan was on a visit Mexico City. Last Jan. 5, two weeks before his inauguration, Mr.  Reagan met the Mexican leader in Ciudad Juarez, a border community across the Bridge of Friendship from El Paso, Tex. They then pledged to establish a ''personal relationship'' to help ease tensions between Mexico and the United States.
The schedule calls for senior aides to both leaders to travel to Camp David tomorrow morning, remain there for the evening and return to the White House Tuesday for a state luncheon. Despite the presence of the aides, the two leaders are expected to spend at least some of the time alone.
The plan, for example, calls for them to take a long stroll in the woods tomorrow afternoon, and an official said ''some form of recreation,'' possibly including horseback riding, is in store.

Immigration1.0-34768,"VESSEL BEGINS VIGIL FOR ALIENS TODAY ,",1981,10,new york times,AP,section 1,454.0,"The Coast Guard cutter Hamilton tomorrow will begin intercepting boats suspected of transporting il legal aliens, officials here announced today.
The patrol will put into effect a new policy of the Reagan Administration to stem the flow of refugees, principally those fleeing the impoverished Caribbean nation of Haiti, who enter the United States by boat.
Petty Officer Dan Walbschmidt, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the Hamilton was sailing today from the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince to refuel at the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She is to begin its patrol tomorrow afternoon.
Coast Guard Cutter will begin intercepting boats suspected of transporting illegal aliens off Miami coast
Mr. Walbschmidt said the timetable for the Hamilton's patrol was announced after Coast Guard and United States Immigration and Naturalization Service officials met with representatives of the Haitian Government.
The Administration's policy, announced Sept. 29, has been criticized as racist by leaders of Miami's Haitian refugee community, who have said the policy is intended to exclude the Caribbean refugees because they are black.
The Hamilton has been ordered to move to a patrol position in the Windward Passage between Haiti and Cuba and to stop and board boats suspected of transporting illegal aliens, Mr. Walbschmidt said.
Plan to Board Vessels
A boarding party from the cutter will question the people on board, determine where they are going and, if they do not have visas to enter the United States, tell them to return to their homeland.
The United States Justice Department has said that those refugees who persuade immigration officials that they are fleeing persecution will be taken to Miami for a formal political asylum hearing.
Mr. Walbschmidt said the cutter was equipped with various weapons but it was unlikely they would have to be used. Only four vessels have been fired at by the Coast Guard since 1973, he said, and ''no one was injured.''
The Boston-based, 378-foot cutter will be accompanied on the interdiction patrol by a search plane and two helicopters. A doctor will be aboard the vessel, along with two immigration officials and two interpreters who speak Haitian Creole, the language of almost all the estimated 50,000 Haitians who have landed on Florida shores since 1970.
Meanwhile, Richard Gullage, deputy district director of the immigration service, said only 21 Haitians arrived in South Florida this week. He said the new arrivals landed Wednesday. Mr. Gullage said there were 1,100 refugees, mostly Haitians, at a processing center west of Miami.

Immigration1.0-34926,VETO RULE ATTACKED BY ADMINISTRATION,1981,5,new york times,"By STUART TAYLOR Jr., Special to the New York Times",section a,761.0,"The Reagan Administration has questioned the constitutionality of all legislative vetoes in urging the Supreme Court to strike down a provision in the immigration law that authorizes either house of Congress to veto certain rulings by the Attorney General.
''Various forms of Congressional control of executive action, short of duly enacted legislation, are unconstitutional,'' the Justice Department stated in papers filed in the Supreme Court Friday, in what it said was ''the view of this and previous Administrations.''
The statement contrasted with campaign statements by Mr. Reagan last year and a Republican platform provision, which broadly endorsed use of the legislative veto as a means of controlling regulatory agencies.
A legislative veto is an action by Congress or, in some cases, a Congressional committee to overrule a regulation or other action by an executive branch or independent regulatory agency without meeting the constitutional requirements for enacting a new law.
Justice Department urges Supreme Court to strike down immigration law provision empowering Congress to veto rulings by Attorney GeneralVeto Authorized by 150 Laws
More than 150 existing laws have provisions authorizing legislative vetoes. Some allow either the House, the Senate or a committee of either body to veto specified regulations or other executive branch actions. Others require agreement by both houses on such a veto but allow no role for the President.
In its brief to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department argued that the one-house veto provision in the Immigration and Naturalization Act was unconstitutional because ''any exercise by Congress of its legislative powers must receive the concurrence of both houses and be submitted to the President for his approval or veto.''
The provision ''also violates the separation of powers under the Constitution by involving the legislative branch in the execution of the law,'' the Justice Department argued.
The Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of the legislative veto, which has become increasingly popular in Congress in the last decade but which has been opposed by every President since Herbert Hoover as an encroachment on Presidential powers.

Related Case in Appeals Court
The Justice Department's appeal to the Supreme Court was unusual in that the department had argued successfully against the veto in a case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. The appeals court struck down the one-house veto provision as unconstitutional in December.
The case involved deportation proceedings against Jagdish Rai Chadha, a Kenyan of Indian extraction, who came to the United States in 1966 on a student visa and sought to stay after the visa expired in 1972. He said it would be difficult or impossible for him to return to Kenya or go to Great Britain because of his race.
Immigration officials ''suspended'' deportation of Mr. Chadha on hardship grounds, under a provision of the immigration act authorizing the Attorney General or his designate to take such action subject to the power of either house of Congress to invalidate it.
The House disapproved this decision without debate or a recorded vote and called for the deportation of Mr. Chadha and five other aliens in December 1975. Joshua Eilberg, then a Democratic Representative from Pennsylvania and the sponsor of the disapproval resolution, said that the six aliens did not appear to meet the legal requirements for suspension of deportation.

Ruling Praised by Carter
Mr. Chadha's lawyers, joined by the Justice Department, asked the appeals court to declare as unconstitutional the legislative veto and the immigration act provision.
The appeals court's ruling in favor of Mr. Chadha was the first time a Federal court had invalidated a legislative veto provision.  Jimmy Carter, then President, praised the decision as ''profoundly significant.''
Justice Department lawyers had said that they would seek a Supreme Court ruling affirming this decision, hoping to resolve the constitutionality of legislative vetoes, and that there was precedent for such an appeal in cases involving the constitutionality of acts of Congress.
Last month, the Justice Department denounced as unconstitutional a bill that would give either house of Congress the power to veto rules and regulations adopted by Federal agencies in the absence of contrary action by the other house.

Immigration1.0-35268,WHAT AN ETHIOPIAN MUST DO TO PROVE DESERVING OF ASYLUM,1982,2,new york times,,section a,541.0,"To the Editor:
Assistant Secretary of State Chester A. Crocker's letter (Feb. 1) charging Anthony Lewis with ''gross inaccuracies and distortions'' in his column on the deportation of Ethiopians (Jan. 4) is devoid of evidence supporting Mr. Crocker's assertions.
Mr. Lewis's column demonstrates the glaring inconsistency of our U.N. Ambassador's scathing condemnation of human-rights abuses and political repression in Ethiopia in light of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's demand, during the same month, that thousands of Ethiopians depart this country within 30 days.
Instead of elucidating this paradox, Mr. Crocker's letter served only to underscore the hypocritical treatment Ethiopians seeking refuge in the United States will face. He makes this alarming statement:
''Although the human-rights picture in Ethiopia is still very bleak, the level of chaos and violence in most of the country has declined since the period of the Red Terror and the other postrevolutionary excesses. It is now possible for Ethiopians who are not on their Government's 'wanted' list to return without fear of falling victim to persecution.''
C O'Neill Brown and Viviane Eisenberg letter refers to January 4 column by Anthony Lewis, ""Hypocracy Wins Again""
While admitting the bleakness of the ''human-rights picture'' in Ethiopia, circumstances Ambassador Kirkpatrick more aptly termed ''savagery,'' Mr. Crocker pronounces that, in order to be granted political asylum, an Ethiopian must prove that he is on the Government's ''wanted'' list.
It is absurd to maintain that such an identifiable list exists, and ludicrous to think that any refugee should have had the foresight to have secured a copy of it. Such a high standard is patently unfair and discriminatory, and it definitely overshoots Mr. Crocker's stated goal of bringing the status of Ethiopians ''in line with that of most other nationalities.''
Are Cubans, Russians, Poles or other East Europeans who also flee Soviet-inspired political repression required to show inclusion on a ''wanted'' list of their government in order to obtain political asylum? Most decidedly not. Such a standard for determining ''a well-founded fear of persecution'' has no basis in the law or in the I.N.S. regulations or operating instructions. Moreover, adherence to such a standard would violate this country's international commitments under the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.
Rather than contradicting Mr. Lewis's article, Mr. Crocker's letter exemplifies the ''particular political callousness'' of our Government toward Ethiopians characterized by Mr. Lewis.
It is, to say the least, difficult to explain why unusually high standards are set for Ethiopians seeking refuge in the United States. It was also difficult to explain the recent reinstatement of tax-exempt status for racially discriminatory schools. However, in that case, the President had the courage to admit and seek to correct his mistake.
The case of the Ethiopians is a terrible mistake yet in the making. We pray this Government has the strength to undo it before an unspeakable toll is paid in human suffering.

Immigration1.0-35064,'WE SIMPLY CANNOT REMAIN A NATION WITHOUT BORDERS',1982,10,new york times,,section a,522.0,"To the Editor:
The much-heralded yet widely misunderstood Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration Reform bill (H.R. 6514, S. 2222) has been endorsed by many as the answer to our immigration problems. They should know that the House Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, has gutted the measure and made it one which will only worsen those problems.
As amended by the committee, the bill has three basic weaknesses:
* It leaves intact the system of ''preferences'' for admitting relatives of immigrants already here legally, leaving the door open for serious abuses (such as the petition of one immigrant who sought entry for 69 relatives).
The much-heralded yet widely misunderstood Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration Reform bill (H.R. 6514, S. 2222) has been endorsed by many as the answer to our immigration problems.
* The bill's sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens have been weakened to the point where the U.S. will continue to be an economic magnet. The combination of the aliens' desire for jobs and the willingness of some employers to obtain cheap, often sub-minimum-wage or even ''hidden'' labor has resulted in thousands of cases of border jumping. Still, employers will have a terribly large new paperwork burden thrust upon them.
* The bill legalizes the presence of all those who have already entered the country illegally by granting them amnesty. This merely encourages more aliens to cross our borders in the hope of beating the deadline for amnesty, while discouraging those wading patiently through our immigration red tape.
Furthermore, the committee adopted, then rejected, and then adopted again a limited provision of Federal reimbursement of state and local welfare and social service costs which could be generated by many of those granted amnesty, so state and local taxpayers would probably have to foot a substantial part of the bill for the amnesty.
Frankly, I never was convinced that the measure would correct the immigration law's weaknesses, which open our borders to an excessive number of legal and illegal immigrants. The estimate of illegal aliens in the U.S. is already as high as 12 million, on top of which we have accepted as many as 800,000 immigrants, refugees and other entrants a year, more than all other countries combined.
These great numbers produce several serious problems, including the displacement of Americans from their jobs and increases in the taxpayer burden of providing social services.
I would hope the U.S. could continue as much as possible its ''open door'' tradition toward the displaced, the persecuted and the ambitious of the world. However, the reality of our economic and resource situation is that we simply cannot remain a nation without borders. We must limit the influx of aliens and have an orderly and fair system for admitting those we are able to absorb.
The Simpson-Mazzoli measure, as reported by the House Judiciary Committee, provides neither, so it cannot be regarded either as a true reform of our messed-up immigration laws or as the first step toward restoring order to our immigration system.
If it cannot be amended on the floor of the House to remedy these deficiencies, it should be defeated.
F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER JR., Member of Congress, 9th Dist., Wis., Washington, Sept. 28, 1982

Immigration1.0-35361,4 ARE CONVICTED OF ENSLAVING MIGRANT WORKERS IN THE SOUTH,1983,8,new york times,,section a,582.0,"A farm labor crew chief, his two sons and another man were convicted today of holding migrant workers in slavery.
After a day and a half of deliberation, a Federal jury found the men guilty of forcefully keeping the workers, recruited along the East Coast in 1979 and 1980, in involuntary servitude at two Southern labor camps through threats of violence and actual beatings.
Attorneys for the four defendants, Willie Warren, 49 years old, Willie Warren Jr., 26, Richard Warren, 24, and Michael Moore, 21, said the verdict should be appealed. Federal District Judge Ben Krentzman, who revoked a $25,000 bond on Willie Warren and Willie Warren Jr., said he feared for the safety of witnesses who testified against the men.
Larry Hart, an assistant United States attorney, called the verdict an important statement about the civil and constitutional rights of such laborers. ''It shows there are no second- class citizens,'' he said, ''even among migrant workers.''

Story of Human Bondage'
In closing arguments to the jury, Susan J. King, another Federal prosecutor, called the evidence ''a story of human bondage, despite the fact that slavery was outlawed in this country in 1865.''
Miss King said the Warrens and Mr. Moore had enticed the workers by making false promises of high wages. Instead, she said, they were taken to fields where they were forced to dig potatoes seven days a week and cheated out of their promised wages.
The prosecution said the Warrens sold food, wine and cigarettes to workers at the isolated camps at prices so high that many of the workers ended the week owing the Warrens more money than they had earned.
Edwin Ivy, Willie Warren's attorney, said Mr. Warren was within his rights when he sold the workers food and wine. He also said that many of the workers who said they were held against their will were taken by Mr. Warren to doctors and social workers outside the camp.

'I Felt Like a Slave'
''These are not the acts of a man trying to run a slave camp,'' Mr. Ivy said in his argument at the close of the 10-day trial.
Richard Simmons, 45, an unemployed cook from Atlanta, told the jury he was picked up by Richard Warren and promised a job unloading trucks for $4.50 an hour in Augusta, Ga. Instead he was taken to a migrant camp in North Carolina and forced to work.
At the end of three months of working for the Warrens digging potatoes at 25 cents a bucket, Mr. Simmons said, he was left with $40. ''I felt like a slave,'' Mr. Simmons said in an interview last Friday. ''No one ever beat me or held a gun to my head but I saw other people beaten. I learned what to do to avoid trouble. I worked hard and said 'Yes, sir, No, sir' all the time to avoid it.''
Taking the stand in his defense, Willie Warren said he did not force workers to drink nor did he try to hire alcoholics. He said he had to buy wine and cigarettes for workers because they demanded it and he said he paid his workers fairly for their labors.  Mr. Warren's attorney said afterward that his client's credibility was shaken when he told the jury his former attorney had told him to lie in giving a deposition in a civil trial. That attorney took the stand as a rebuttal witness and said he had given no such advice.
Mr. Warren, Willie Warren Jr. and Mr. Moore could be sentenced to 20 years in prison and a $25,000 fine. Richard Warren could receive a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and $20,000 in fines. The men will be sentenced Aug. 30.

Immigration1.0-35194,50 IN PEACE GROUP TO GET VISAS FOR SESSION AT U.N.,1982,6,new york times,By PETER KIHSS,section b,705.0,"Fifty members of the World Peace Council who were denied visas to attend United Nations disarmament sessions starting here Monday have now been approved for restricted entry, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said yesterday.
The State Department said Wednesday that the council was ''an organization with strong affiliations'' to the Soviet Communist Party. It did so in reporting the denial of visas to 348 Japanese as members of a group close to the council.
The department acted under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, but said later that it was recommending Justice Department waivers to admit most of the Japanese.
Fifty members of the World Peace Council who were denied visas to attend United Nations disarmament sessions starting here Monday have now been approved for restricted entry, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said yesterday.
Duke Austin, an immigration spokesman in Washington, said the Peace Council members were separate from 376 cases being reviewed individually. The council members were approved, he said, because they had been officially invited by the United Nations.'' But he said they would be restricted to being within 25 miles of Columbus Circle.

Leader Was Barred
While Mr. Austin could not immediately name the 50, Michael Myerson, executive director of the U.S. Peace Council, said the world council's president, Romesh Chandra of India, had been originally barred along with four other members of the council's secretariat and more than 20 others.
The others, he said, included Gen. Francisco da Costa Gomes, former President of Portugal, and James A. Lamond, a member of the British Parliament, both vice presidents of the peace group, and retired General Nino Pasti, of Italy, a former deputy commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Italy.
Alan Romberg, a State Department spokesman, said the department had asked for a waiver for General Pasti, excluded initially because he was elected to the Italian Parliament on a Communist slate. He said there was no record in Washington of applications by General Gomes or Mr. Lamond.
In a Federal District Court hearing in Manhattan yesterday, Thomas Belote, special assistant United States Attorney, said a visa had been authorized Tuesday for a representative of the South-West Africa People's Organization.
Mr. Myerson said this was Theo Ben Gouriab, the organization's permanent representative to the United Nations for nine years.

Canadian Stopped at Border
Yesterday morning, Kay MacPherson, past president of the Voice of Women in Canada, who is scheduled to speak at a June 12 disarmament rally, was barred from entering by car at Champlain, N.Y. In Ottawa, she said she had been coming to a meeting of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, which started at Barnard College yesterday.
Mr. Austin said her name was on a list of persons subject to exclusion because of affiliation with certain organizations. Miss MacPherson said Canada's Ministry of External Affairs was looking into her exclusion.
In Federal Court, Judge Pierre Leval ordered the United States Attorney's office to provide information at 3 P.M. today in response to a suit by the American and New York Civil Liberties Unions seeking immediate entry documents for foreign visitors to the United Nations sessions.
The suit claimed First Amendment constitutional rights for Americans to exchange ideas with United Nations visitors. It also cited a 1947 agreement between the United Nations and the United States, in which the United States pledged to refrain from impeding transit for accredited representatives of accredited nongovernmental organizations.
Steven R. Shapiro, counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union, told the judge: ''What may be the legitimate concern of government in certain instances is not at issue here because this is a United Nations-sponsored activity.''
For the Government, Mr. Belote said ''every officially invited delegate has been permitted to come,'' but as to others ''it is the sovereign power of the United States to determine who may enter.'' Judge Leval noted that any plaintiff claim could be lost by the rapid ''ticking of the clock.''

Immigration1.0-35949,A STEEL VALLEY'S DEATH: MEMORIES AND DESPAIR,1984,1,new york times,By WILLIAM SERRIN,section a,1547.0,"The Talk

of the

Monongahela

Valley
HOMESTEAD, Pa., Jan. 7 - What Carol Couvaris remembers of the good times in Homestead is the candy her father made. He ran the United Candy Store at Eighth Avenue for 70 years, and today her face lights up and she smiles when she talks about it.  He made bonbons, seafoams, fudges, ribbon candy, chewing taffies, scotches, taffy apples, all kinds of brittles, caramel corn, marshmallows. At Christmas, he made his own candy canes. At Easter, he made huge chocolate rabbits and baskets. All the candies were hand dipped. He used fresh cream, she said, and the best ingredients.
For generations the Monongahela Valley, with Homestead at the center, was the steelmaking capital of the world. The steel industry attracted immigrants from throughout Europe, and although the work was hard and dirty, the people brought to this valley a strong family life and strong neighborhoods. Many of the families were religious, and throughout the valley today are many huge churches, including many onion- domed Eastern Orthodox churches that make the valley seem so much like the Europe the immigrants left behind.
Small Symbol of Decline
An interest in fine candies was one of the customs the immigrants brought. There are candy shops yet, even on bleak streets. But the special, hand-dipped candies with rich, fresh ingredients are almost gone, and this is a small, precise symbol of the decline of life in this once great manufacturing valley.
On March 17 Mrs. Couvaris and her husband, George, will have run their small restaurant, the Sweet Shoppe, for 34 years, and they have watched this decline through their front window. Mrs. Couvaris's father's candy shop has been gone for a decade. The couple sell some candies in their cafe; candy used to be 80 percent of the business, but now is only 20 percent. ''People can't afford to buy candy anymore,'' Mr. Couvaris said.
Mr. Couvaris, standing by the coffee pot behind the counter, said he did not understand the decline of the steel industry. This valley, he said, produced rifles for Union soldiers in the Civil War, and rails for the railroads that built the West. He said, ''Did you ever see the movie 'How Green Was My Valley'? '' referring to the 1941 movie about the harshness of life in a Welsh coal town. ''That's us,'' he said.
The growth of the steel industry built the Monongahela Valley, which runs some 20 miles along the Monongahela River, south and east of Pittsburgh, and now the decline of the steel industry is destroying it. Plants have been closed, thousands of jobs lost over recent years. And then last week, in a devastating blow, the United States Steel Corporation announced it was closing almost two dozen plants, eliminating some 15,400 jobs, including 3,800 in the valley.
''A lot of guys are forced to take retirement,'' says the Rev. Garrett Dorsey of St. Stephen's Catholic Church in Hazelwood, across the river from Homestead. He is chairman of the Tri-State Conference on Steel, a church, university and labor group trying to stem industrial decline in this area of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. ''Some guys are getting jobs elsewhere, but a lot are not. A lot of young people will be forced to leave.''
At the Goodwill Industries store in Homestead, where a coat can be bought for $9.95, an upholstered chair for $39, ice skates for $2, the store manager, Irene Schrecengost, said business was all right, but should be better. ''People are not used to buying second hand,'' she said, and ''I personally think the workers feel degraded'' by shopping at Goodwill. She hopes this changes.
The Monongahela Valley is a wretched place today. Old men with white hair sit playing cards in the window of the Owls Club in Homestead. Part of Hazelwood is known as Plywood Avenue, for the boarded storefronts. Throughout the valley, the vast, tall steelworks, with their huge buildings, furnaces, and smokestacks, are closed. So are many job shops that were supported by the steel industry.
From a high hill in Clairton, far up the valley, one can see smoke rising from the vast coke works there, still in operation, but the view is largely one of an industrial America, an era that is no more. Miles of unneeded railroad cars sit parked on the plant tracks; weeds grow out of some of them.
When an industry dies, the towns that depend on it die with it. Mayor Louis H. Washowich sat in his City Hall office in McKeesport on a cold, gray snowy afternoon and talked of how decline of the steel industry, and specifically of United States Steel's National Works there, had affected the town. In 1940, McKeesport had 55,000 people. Today, the Mayor said, the town has 31,000. He said that two years ago the National Works employed 3,500 workers. It now has 400, and last week's announcement by the company means another 100 jobs will be cut.
It used to be that on payday, twice a month, thousands of workers would spill through the gates of the plants in this valley with money that would immediately spread through the town's businesses. Today those checks are no longer there, and for McKeesport and towns like it, this means immense difficulties. The wage tax in McKeesport has declined by $200,000 a year. Income at the parking garages, where many workers left their cars, has dropped $150,000. The mercantile tax is off, and people are falling behind in their property tax payments.
Mr. Washowich, 44, was born in this town, grew up here, and, he said, ''I could never in my wildest dreams think of a place I want to live outside the place of McKeesport.'' But what he sees here is not only industrial but kind of a social decline. With the job loss, he said, ''there are a large number of people in the valley for which this is probably the most degrading time of their life.''
He says the town has lost much of its sense of neighborhoods and the ethnicity that once gave it such character. He says many parents no longer seem interested in what their children are doing and in what their children's futures will be.
The Mayor said that, while he knew financial analysts applauded decisions like those made by United States Steel as making eminent financial sense, he felt those analysts' equations lacked factors to represent people and communities. He sees no one addressing these problems. He said, ''If we continue to go the way we've gone over the last 20 years, and it continues over the next 20 years, I hope to hell I'm not here.''
In each town up and down the Mon Valley, as it is called here, there may be one or two things that most symbolize the robustness that this area once had and the decline of today. In Braddock, on the north side of the river, a symbol is the Carnegie Library, built beginning in 1889 and the oldest of the many libraries built by Andrew Carnegie, the magnate who sold his vast steel holdings in 1901 to the new United States Steel Corporation.
This was once a magnificent stone library, three stories and turreted, the pride of the town. For decades the company supplied the heat and light free. When it no longer wished to do this, the library was acquired by the Braddock school district, but the district could not afford to keep the library open and closed it in 1972. The roof has since sprung leaks, ruining many rooms and books. Windows are boarded.
The building is now owned by the Braddock's Field Historical Society - on July 9, 1755, British and Colonial troops under Gen. Edward Braddock were defeated here in an early encounter of the French and Indian War - and the other day a visitor tapping on the door, encountered one man inside, Roy Stell, second vice president of the society.
For 34 years Mr. Stell was a locomotive engineer, hauling raw material to the steel mills until he retired. Now he is working zealously with other history-minded Braddock people to restore the library, although that seems almost impossible for, he says, it would take more than $5 million to do this.

Shadow of Former Grandeur
He guided the visitor for two hours through the cold library, showing the grandeur it once had. Here was the huge tile pool where Mr. Stell swam as a youth; here the meeting room for the Tuesday evening women's club; nearby the billiard room and the two- lane bowling alley, where pins were set by hand.
Mr. Stell would walk into a dark room, snap on a light, and there would be shelves and shelves of books, unopened for years. In the corner, the oak-walled gymnasium, where - this was before basketball was invented - generations of Braddock boys exercised by climbing ropes and lifting wooden clubs. In the basement were the baths, where workers, grimy and tired from a day in the mill up Braddock Avenue, could bathe or shower for a nickel.
Mr. Stell stood by a kerosene heater he was fueling to warm a bit of the small corner room now open for a few hours on Saturdays as a children's library. ''This was quite a place years ago,'' he said, talking at once of the library, the town, the valley. ''Today you walk around and you look at it, and you try to figure in your head what happened.''
What did he think had happened, a visitor asked.
''I can't figure it out,'' he said.

''And what is a back-up sandwich?'' his father asked.  ''It's in case you don't like the food the other kids bring - you've got a back-up,'' Michael explained.  This was the day before the long holiday began: each child brought something from home to share with Mrs. Shapiro's fourth-grade class.  So Michael's mother packed along a potato pudding for 30.  His mother never does anything simple. On Mexican holidays she sends pinadas to school; on Halloween Michael dresses like a bumblebee, even though stingers don't fit on school buses; on Orville Wright's birthday she probably will send in a biplane.
Are we the only overachiever parents in the school district? Do others make such a big deal about what their children bring into school these days? What can you tell about the home someone comes from by what he brings to class? Is the quality of food like a label on a pair of jeans?
About Long Island column discusses elementary school 'status' symbols
Michael was asked what sort of delicacies other children brought in.  ''Someone brought a licorice cookie. Someone else brought something like a cookie with an almond inside.'' Anything else?  ''Somebody brought in green salad and someone brought in chocolate mousse.  ''Danny brought in ruggelech. Jeannie - her name's spelled J-e-nn-e -brought in fudge. Mrs. Lauria brought in a friendship bag and somebody brought fettuccine Alfredo and someone else brought in ziti.''
And what did you eat, Michael?  ''The chocolate mousse, the licorice cookies, the ziti and a hot fudge sundae. I also had my sandwich - salami on a bagel - my apple and my soda.''
There is another status symbol in the school system these days: what celebrity can you interview for Mr. Desmond's journalism class at Herricks High School?
Michael's sister, Ellen, a student of Mr. Desmond's, didn't want much: Billy Joel, a Long Islander. Maybe, thought Ellen, her father could use his influence to get Billy Joel.
Influence peddling apparently is big in school these days. One student wound up interviewing Barbara Walters; another spoke to a Channel 5 newswoman; Ellen went to lunch with the actress who plays Morgan Richards Nelson, a character on ''The Guiding Light,'' the CBS-TV soap opera.
Then there was the young man from the class who called Ellen's father and wanted to meet Richard Todd, the Jets' quarterback.  These were busy days for Richard Todd; he was trying to bring the Jets into the playoffs. But he said, sure, he would do it.  So the young journalism student and his mother went to the Jets' camp, which forms an enclave at Hofstra University.  They watched practice and the mother said: ''I should have taken my husband here instead. He would have got a bigger kick out of it than my son.''
Later, they waited for the quarterback, who was taking a shower after practice.  The young journalism student went over his questions, rereading each one, hoping it was clear.  Then the quarterback appeared.  ''Can I get y'all a Coke?'' he asked, going to a refrigerator.  Then he sat down and spent 15 minutes with the budding reporter.  When it was over, he said, ''Would you like a football?'' and brought the boy into the locker room and gave him an autographed ball.

Then he gave the mother a peck on the cheek and said goodbye.  ''I'm not going to wash my face for a week, '' said the mother.
Michael's father got 12 letters the same day. All were from Miss Schwarzchild's fifth-grade class at the John Lewis Child School in Floral Park.
They each wondered if, perhaps, he could speak to their class about writing newspaper stories.  Why, of course, Michael's father thought. After all, these kids could have had any celebrity in New York. And look who they picked.  But the acclaim wasn't over. For on the very day that he brought the potato pudding into Michael's class, Mrs. Shapiro wondered, ''When do you think you could speak to our class?''
So Michael's father had found a new career: talking to public school students in the mornings. Some day, he hoped, he might even make it to a junior high school. Now, that's status.

Immigration1.0-35437,ADMINISTRATION BALKS AT COST OF AMNESTY FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS,1983,4,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section 1,873.0,"The Reagan Administration has expressed concern about the cost of providing social welfare benefits to more than a million illegal aliens who could qualify for legal status under bills moving swiftly through both houses of Congress.
The Senate began debate on its bill Thursday and adopted several amendments. Under a unanimous consent agreement, the Senate, after debating the budget resolution next week, will return to the immigration bill on May 9, with a vote on final passage tentatively set for May 10.
Aides to David A. Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said budget analysts had estimated the Senate bill would cost the Government $9.3 billion over four years. The House bill, scheduled to be taken up by the Judiciary Committee in early May, would cost $4.5 billion over four years, the budget office estimated.
WASHINGTON, April 29 - The Reagan Administration has expressed concern about the cost of providing social welfare benefits to more than a million illegal aliens who could qualify for legal status under bills moving swiftly through both houses of Congress.
Despite such fiscal concerns, members of the Reagan Administration, especially Attorney General William French Smith, remains strongly committed to a comprehensive bill as a way to curtail illegal immigration.

Both Bills Offer Legal Status
The Senate and House bills are similar. Both would forbid employers to hire undocumented aliens but would offer legal status to aliens who had lived illegally in the United States from a specified date.  The eligibility date in the Senate bill is Jan. 1, 1980; in the House bill it is Jan. 1, 1981.
A senior Administration official quoted President Reagan as saying at a Cabinet meeting last week, ''The bill is important, but if it costs too much, we'll veto it.'' A spokesman for Mr. Stockman said the Administration would convey its concerns to the sponsors of the immigration bills, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky.
The Administration's cost estimate for the Simpson bill is more than twice the estimate made by the Congressional Budget Office. The Administration assumed that there were 6.25 million aliens in the country illegally and that 1.7 million would obtain legal status under the bill. The Congressional Budget Office assumed that there were 4.5 million illegal aliens, of whom 920,000 would be granted amnesty.
Congressional aides and even critics of the legislation said it had an excellent chance of passing. Arnoldo S. Torres, executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said he opposed the bill because he believed it would increase employment discrimination against Hispanic Americans. But he added, ''The chances are very good that it is going to pass.''

Three-Year Waiting Period
The bill before the Senate would grant permanent resident status to aliens who entered the country illegally before Jan. 1, 1977. It would offer temporary resident status to aliens who entered illegally before Jan. 1, 1980.
The permanent residents would become eligible for food stamps, medical assistance and other Federal benefits after a three-year waiting period. The temporary residents would not be eligible for Federal benefits, but they could become permanent residents three years after enactment of the bill. So they could obtain Federal benefits six years after attaining legal status.
The cost estimates are uncertain because no one knows for sure how many illegal aliens live in the United States or how many would seek amnesty. A new study by the Census Bureau suggests no more than four million aliens were residing in this country illegally at the time of the 1980 census. That figure is substantially below the estimates used by many members of Congress and students of immigration policy.
In the 1980 census, the Government asked some people whether they were citizens or aliens but did not try to determine whether the aliens were here legally. Government demographers compared the census count of aliens, including legal and illegal residents, with an estimate of the ''true'' number of legal aliens, derived from Immigration and Naturalization Service records.

2 Million Counted in 1980
The new study by Robert Warren and Jeffrey S. Passell, demographic statisticians at the Census Bureau, concludes that two million illegal aliens were included in the 1980 census. Since the census probably found more than half of all illegal aliens, they said, the total is almost certainly less than four million. This does not include seasonal migrants.
Of the undocumented aliens counted in 1980, the Census Bureau estimated that 45 percent were from Mexico, 17 percent from Central America and the Caribbean, 12 percent from Europe, 12 percent from Asia, 7 percent from South America, 5 percent from Africa, Australia and the Pacific Islands and 2 percent from Canada.
''All areas which send legal immigrants appear to send illegal immigrants,'' the study said, but ''no single country besides Mexico appears to contribute a substantial proportion of the illegal alien population.'' The census found that the United States had a foreignborn population of 14 million, including six million naturalized citizens.
Almost 30 percent of the illegal aliens counted in 1980 had been in the country more than 10 years, the report estimated. An additional 27 percent had been in the country from five to 10 years.

Immigration1.0-35843,ALIENS BILL NEARS REALITY,1984,6,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section a,1074.0,"Why, after so much delay, did a comprehensive immigration bill suddenly start rolling through the House of Representatives?
The very factors that delayed the legislation for several years now seem to be working in its favor. After five straight days of solid progress, the House resumes consideration of the bill Tuesday, facing the politically difficult question of whether to grant legal status to illegal aliens already in the United States. A final vote on passage of the bill could come late Tuesday or Wednesday.
Analysis of factors in delay of passage of comprehensive immigration and sudden flurry of legislative activity in House in effort to get bill passed; factors that delayed legislation for several years now seem to be working in its favor; concentrated opposition from Hispanic leaders has kept measure off House floor for year, but diffused support is bringing it to vote (M)
The bill always had concentrated opposition and diffused support. The concentrated opposition, from Hispanic leaders in particular, kept the measure off the House floor for a year, but the diffused support proved more significant when the full House started voting.
Every so often the House, as an institution, rises to a large challenge. ''A failure to deal with this issue could be fatal to our ability to deal with other issues of wide, sweeping social and economic impact,'' said Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, Democrat of Wisconsin. ''Institutionally, it's important that we be able to report out a bill.''
Election-year politics, which had been expected to obstruct the bill, seemed instead to increase the momentum behind it. House members said they did not want to go back home having done nothing about illegal immigration, even though many were unsure whether this specific bill was the right answer to the problem. To a remarkable degree, House Republicans were united in favor of the bill, which is strongly supported by the Reagan Administration, and Democrats fought among themselves over various amendments.

No Unity for Democrats
The three Democratic candidates for President have all spoken against the bill, but they did not unify the party behind their position.
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus fought tenaciously, but proved weaker than expected. Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat whose mother was born in Mexico, said: ''We as the Hispanic Caucus failed to come up with a realistic alternative that could pass. We were not well organized. We did not educate members.''
The bill authorizes the Government to fine employers up to $2,000 for each illegal alien they hire. Hispanic groups asserted that this would lead to an increase in discrimination because employers would avoid hiring people with a foreign accent or dark skin. But the bipartisan coalition that usually supports civil rights legislation was divided, and many of its members were able to support the immigration bill with a clear conscience after adding legal remedies for victims of discrimination.

Curbs on Legal Immigration
Restrictionist sentiment, a desire to restrict legal as well as illegal immigration, proved stronger than expected. Representative Hal Daub, Republican of Nebraska, said that ''no reasonable person'' wanted to stop immigration entirely, but that it must be limited. ''The demographics and costs of immigration are staggering,'' he said, and there is a ''growing resentment of immigrants and immigration.''
Florida Republicans such as Representative Bill McCollum testified to the strain that illegal immigration could put on a community. Haitians apprehended in a boat off the Florida coast should not have any more legal rights than a stowaway or a foreign crewman who jumps ship, he said.
Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza, a Texas Democrat, complained at one point: ''The basic intent of this legislation is not reform. It is a pervasive attempt by someone to keep foreigners out.''
Those who want to retain the current policy encouraging legal immigration prevailed over those who wanted to impose numerical limits, but the outcome was in doubt for a while.
On key issues, the bill's chief sponsor, Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky, positioned himself on what he said was a ''middle ground.'' Organized labor, like the House Committee on Education and Labor, wanted new safeguards to protect American farm workers and aliens brought into the country to harvest seasonal crops. Farmers, like the Agriculture Committee, wanted a new program to bring in aliens as temporary farm workers.

'Killer Amendments'
Usually this strategy worked; occasionally it failed. But Mr. Mazzoli persuaded the House to defeat all the ''killer amendments,'' those that, in his view, would have fatally undermined the bill.
Mr. Mazzoli had always said he had a clear majority in support of his position on any major amendment and that the only question was whether House leaders would give the House an opportunity to vote. The events of last week suggest that he was right.
''Some thought the House would dissolve into rancor, bitterness and discord, but that has not happened,'' Mr. Mazzoli said. 'The issue is not as nettlesome and full of land mines as we were told by the opposition.''
The most powerful opponents of the bill in 1982, the growers who use illegal aliens to pick fruit and vegetables, changed their strategy this year and, instead of fighting the bill, successfully sought amendments.
With the help of a well-financed lobbying campaign, they persuaded the House to create a special foreign worker program for producers of perishable crops. The debate over the proposal highlighted the split in Democratic ranks: Leon E. Panetta of California was the chief proponent; George Miller, also from California, was the chief opponent.

Leeway for Agriculture
The House bill, like its Senate counterpart, would create a three-year transition program for agricultural labor, giving farmers three years more than other industries to halt the use of illegal aliens. And the House, by a vote of 285 to 133, upheld a section of the bill that would prevent immigration officers from entering a farm or field except with the owner's consent or a search warrant. The Senate bill contains a similar provision, so it is likely to remain in the legislation.
For most of the 435 House members, immigration is a back-burner issue to which they usually pay little attention. But it is also a subject about which they feel strongly because it is intertwined with the history of America and its ideals, as well as its future. ''What we are deciding here is the future of the ethnic fabric of our nation,'' said Representative Robert Garcia, Democrat of the Bronx.

Immigration1.0-35908,AMERICAN IMMIGRANTS WHO COME AND GO,1984,3,new york times,,section a,259.0,"To the Editor:
In a March 13 news article, ''Some Greeks Find Promise of U.S. Fades,'' you say that ''for the first time, a growing number of Greek immigrants are thinking about leaving the United States and returning to Greece. . . .''
For centuries, Greeks have been migrating to all parts of the world - and for centuries, they have been returning home in droves. Oscar Handlin, who wrote of this tendency among Greek and other immigrants nearly three decades ago (''Immigrants Who Go Back,'' Atlantic, July 1956), noted that ''from the start, the currents of trans-Atlantic migration has flowed in both directions.''
Indeed, during the first three decades of this century, nearly four million immigrants left the United States for Europe.
But the return home was not necessarily permanent. The process of migration and transplantation transforms Greek immigrants into Greek-Americans, Greek-Australians or Greek-Canadians, and the memory of the new land pulls them back like a magnet.
I have an aunt who has crossed the Atlantic eight times in the last 15 years, each time believing she was making a permanent move. Her latest crossing, made last August, took her back to Athens.  In her most recent letters to me, she wrote of how she longed for Astoria (New York).
Her plight - the vain search for the best of both lands - is by no means unique. A word for Greeks who go back: Greece won't be what you think it is, anymore than the United States was what you expected it to be.

SAN YSIDRO, Calif., July 7 (UPI) -United States immigration officials, puzzled by an apparent drop in illegal immigration from Mexico, speculated today that devaluation of the peso might be partly responsible.Sector of the Federal Border Patrol, said, ''Smugglers traditionally insist upon payment in dollars. It now takes more pesos to buy dollars. That may be a factor.''
Through June, 171,559 aliens have been arrested in the Chula Vista Sector, which includes San Diego. The arrests are down by 28,212, or 14 percent, from the same period last year, and officials said it could mean fewer illegal aliens were trying to sneak into the United States. A comparable decline has been noted along the Texas border.
But Mr. Wood cautioned the figures might not reflect a trend.''The decline is fairly recent, and may be a fluke,'' he said.

The Government also asked Judge Spellman to issue a separate ruling that would allow the Immigration and Naturalizaion Service to detain refugees who came to Florida in the next 60 days.

A detailed account of Mr. Dodder's violations has been sealed by Federal District Judge Walter M. Nixon Jr. and will be expunged if Mr. Dodder completes his probation without further violations.

Immigration1.0-35951,Books: Illegal Aliens,1984,1,new york times,By Richard F. Shepard,section c,472.0,"THE TARNISHED DOOR: The New Immigrants and the Transformation of America. By John Crewdson. 354 pages. Times Books. $17.95.
NOBODY knows how many illegal immigrants enter the United States, but there are estimates that have placed their number as high as one million in recent years. According to John Crewdson, who won a 1981 Pulitzer Prize for his reporting in The New York Times on immigration problems, perhaps a half million newcomers arrived illegally in 1980, while three-quarters of a million arrived within the law.
Richard F Shepard reviews book The Tarnished Door by John Crewdson
This sort of enormous movement of humanity has indeed created problems, but Mr. Crewdson, now national editor of The Chicago Tribune, defines the problems much differently than do those who fear that the nation is being swamped by alien tides. In ''The Tarnished Door,'' he assiduously ticks off the pluses and minuses, bulwarking his outlook with compelling statistics and other documentation.
Most of his thesis deals with the Mexican border, and he studies the absolute certainty of immigration caused when a country that cannot provide work for its people borders on one that offers workers better remuneration than they could ever hope for at home. There is no single villain here, but the incompetence, brutality and corruption he and others found in the Immigration and Naturalization Service add up to a major problem, elements that frustrate the most honest and dedicated employees. Moreover, he maintains that the service is hampered by a welter of confusing laws and a legislative reluctance, born of pressure by large-scale employers of alien labor, to come to grips with budget and enforcement.
As for the immigrants themselves, Mr. Crewdson believes they are not the problem. In his view, they fill jobs, demonstrably, that Americans, even the most destitute, will not take. He argues that they contribute more to our economy than they take from it, and they help the economy of their depressed homelands in a way that alleviates the need for foreign aid. They are the hardest workers - in fact, the problem is to protect them from exploitation by unscrupulous labor manipulators. They are in the finest American immigrant tradition, although they probably hail from different areas of the globe than those of us who preceded them. In so doing, they are changing - certainly not for the worse - the very texture of American life.
Mr. Crewdson is thorough and certain of himself in his exposition, which is cogently and interestingly presented. Since he does not agree with what others designate as ''the problem,'' he does not offer solutions, but rather seems to question those proposals that others see as remedies. ''The Tarnished Door'' is a controversial but an absolutely refreshing and different perspective on what has been called one of our country's most pressing issues.

Immigration1.0-35196,CAN THE NUMBERS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS BE CONTROLLED HUMANELY?,1982,5,new york times,,section 4,1969.0,"The Senate Judiciary Committee, by a vote of 16 to 1, last week approved a bill that would overhaul the nation's immigration laws.  The sponsor of the bill, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Antonia Hernandez, director of the Washington office of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, disagree on many of the underlying issues. In separate interviews, they discussed their concerns with Robert Pear, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times. At the outset, each was asked whether the nation had lost control of its borders and whether there should be more enforcement of the immigration laws.
SENATOR SIMPSON: There is a huge flow of undocumented aliens that must be addressed. We will be best about our duties when we legalize that flow instead of seeing it remain illegal, and we think that that's very possible with employer sanctions, an identifier system, an expanded H-2 (temporary worker) program for agricultural and other areas. The true test in the legislation will be the gut-wrenching decision whether the United States has really become so dependent upon the undocumented worker that it cannot get off that particular opiate, or whether we really do want immigration reform and control of the borders.
Question. There have been so many immigration reforms proposed in the last five years. Why do you think yours is better?
The Senate Judiciary Committee, by a vote of 16 to 1, last week approved a bill that would overhaul the nation's immigration laws; following are two interviews discussing the issues
Answer. I would like to think it's because we took the hot stuff and put it right up front and began in our early discussions to deal with the issue of a cap on legal immigration, a staunching of the flow of illegal immigration. We wanted a reform which would not have the characteristics of all our past reforms, which have been racist.  By putting everything on the table early, we had an interesting response and didn't allow it to slip into the evil, vile, hidden kind of stuff that accompanies any significant reforms.
Q. Did you have any reservations about proposing a scheme that would require United States citizens to validate their identity when they apply for a job?
A. Yes, when I first heard that proposed, I rejected it. In fact, much of the original package just gave me the creeps. Then I said: This is impossible; I don't see how we can reject everything and get reform. Maybe I'd better start listening. So I started to listen and I started to research and read, and I became convinced that you have to have employer sanctions or penalties against those who knowingly hire (illegal aliens), and you have to have a universal employment authorization verification. I had a good deal of trepidation, but I said, what are we trying to do? Are we trying to slip over into 1984 and Orwellian theories? Are we trying to intrude upon the private lives and civil liberties of the American people? I would visit with people from the A.C.L.U. and civil libertarians, and I would say, O.K., if you don't like that, what's the alternative? Please give me an alternative, but no fair quoting from the Statue of Liberty. I don't want anybody in the argument to do that.
Q. What are the prospects for this legislation?
A. I think there is a good deal of support for it. I have advised the majority leader that we will have something to be processed. He knows it is a priority item.
Q. Is it correct to say that your bill would, for the first time, put immediate relatives of immigrants under the numerical ceiling for immigration?
A. In setting the 425,000 cap, we are staying with existing levels. We are not cutting away or going up. We do still cherish and embrace the historical traditions of immediate family, and they will still come in. The people of the country are not aware that there has never been any limit on immediate family. It doesn't matter how many would come. They are not totaled against the quotas, the country allocations. What we are saying is: Continue to come in, even if it goes over the quota. But then if it does, then the next year you have a rolling reassessment of that country's quota. Yes, we do in essence place a cap on immediate family and family reunification.  But it is not evidenced because it can go into the second year of the allocation, and there are only one or two or three countries that are heavily affected there.
Q. Why do you put immediate relatives under the ceiling?
A. That figure has gone up about 7 percent a year. That figure 10 years ago was 70,000, and now it is 155,000. Those are unlimited - no numerical limit on those. If we are going to have that type of exponential growth, we ought to be paying attention to it in what is called the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1982.
When we finish the legalization process, those people will be entitled to have their families come here. That's why we must be assured that we watch for that tremendous increase. Once you have legalization, plus five years, plus 3 to 6 million people who all would then have the right to make application for their relatives under the preference system, that's a lot of numbers.
Q. Critics say that your bill would require employers to help enforce the immigration laws. What's the point of that?
A. The idea of employer sanctions draws a quick response: that it's terrible to make the employers of America the policemen of the world. But that is not what this legislation does. If people will take the time to read the bill - it's 78 pages and it's all in English - I think they will be attracted to what we really are trying to do with employer sanctions.
What is expected of the employers is one thing, one tiny small thing: that when they are hiring people, they just check off on the same form, wherever they are asking for the Social Security numbers or whatever they do ordinarily, just say, I asked this person for his identifier or his work authorization, and check the box. And you do that under penalty of perjury.
We knew that if we ever put a tremendous burden on the employer, we would never get to first base. That's why the legislation does not put a tremendous burden on the employer.
MISS HERNANDEZ: We believe that there should be more enforcement, more control of the borders, but there has to be a humane immigration policy. We agree that the Immigration and Nationality Act should be updated, that it is archaic. Our concern is that these people are coming through and are being exploited, and furthermore that their presence here makes the lives of Hispanics much more difficult.
Question. What is your reaction to the recent roundup of more than 5,000 illegal aliens by the Immigration and Naturalization Service?
Answer. It was a public charade that will not in any way affect the overall economic problems of this country. Any day they want, they can pick up that many undocumented persons without making a big public fanfare.
Q. How does that relate to what would happen if Congress enacted the proposal sponsored by Senator Simpson and Representative Romano Mazzoli of Kentucky?
A. The employer sanctions, combined with a multiple identification system, would create the same type of environment. We had reports from Los Angeles that the immigration officers would go into companies, surround the premises, look at the employees, divide them into Latin-looking and Anglo employees, and they wouldn't harass the Anglo employees. They would put all the Latin employees in one corner. Then they would interrogate each and every one of them to see whether they were United States citizens or legal resident aliens.  The added problem is that a lot of United States citizens who were Hispanic Americans didn't have documentation with them. They were taken to the central station until they could prove (their status).  Why should anyone of any heritage in America have to undergo that humiliation, that harassment or that inconvenience?
Q. Is there any way to aggressively enforce the immigration laws without having harassment that discriminates against Hispanic Americans?
A. I don't think so. Basically, the problem of harassment, of intimidation is placed on you because of who you are, your ethnicity, your nationality. I.N.S. people will tell you that they can smell or determine who is an undocumented alien and who is not, but that's a bunch of baloney. There's no way they can tell. People will say, that's why you should have a counterfeit-proof identification card.  Well, that is unrealistic too. Any I.D. card is going to be based on the same documents that are so easily counterfeited. You can buy a birth certificate, you can buy a Social Security card.
Let me give you a very personal example. My father is a United States citizen, and he looks as Mexican as anyone I've ever seen. He had one of the old cards that I.N.S. used to issue with his picture, saying that he is a United States citizen. He carries it with him.  That was never good enough when they used to raid his company. So now he's thinking of getting an American passport to see if that will do, since a passport is much more difficult to get.
Q. Where was he born?
A. In Texas.
Q. Would the Simpson-Mazzoli bill halt the flow of undocumented workers from Mexico?
A. No. It fails to consider the strong economic and social factors, such as higher wages and family reunification, which bring immigrants to this country. People don't understand the economic interdependence and interrelationship between the two countries. I am not saying that we have to have an open border.
Q. Would the Simpson-Mazzoli proposal lead to better enforcement?
A. They don't even enforce the laws they have now. There's nothing in the proposal that would lead us to believe they are going to enforce it. What's going to happen is that we are going to have another law on the books that is not enforced systematically, that will be enforced arbitrarily, in a discriminatory manner.
The Office of Management and Budget came up with statistics saying that a picture I.D. would cost close to $2 billion. Without a picture, it would cost $1 billion. They should put one-quarter of the $1 billion into better management of I.N.S., better border enforcement and try this for a couple of years and see what happens.
Q. What about penalizing employers?
A. Employer sanctions would inevitably result in discrimination against Hispanics and other minority citizens and legal residents.  Employers intent on excluding minorities could conceal their discriminatory practices under the pretext of compliance with the law. On the other hand, well-meaning employers might avoid hiring minorities or 'foreign-looking' applicants for fear of being subjected to employer sanctions.
Q. Have the professionalism and training of I.N.S. agents gotten any better?
A. In all my experiences with the immigration service, and they have been many, by and large I.N.S. officers have been courteous, respectful and understanding. We in our family have never had the questioning and the suspicion at the border, but that to us is part of being Hispanic. It's sort of assumed. At the border we have had very good relationships. My parents fear, they distrust, but they also, in all fairness, have had few unpleasant experiences at the border.
You can't put all the fault on I.N.S. officers. They are overworked, understaffed, given an impossible task, told to enforce the law, but not to enforce the law.

Immigration1.0-35792,CITY IMMIGRATION OFFICE CLOGGED BY CASELOAD,1984,7,new york times,By ELAINE SCIOLINO,section a,1735.0,"The New York district office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service is understaffed, buried in paper work and overwhelmed by antiquated procedures, according to many specialists in the field. Moreover, they say, there will be a torrent of new work if Congress approves new immigration legislation.
Despite some innovations over the last few years, the agency, which handles the largest workload of any district office in the country, simply does not have the resources to keep up with the volume, according to Government officials, private experts who deal regularly with the agency and aliens themselves.
''We're slowly but surely moving into the 20th century,'' said Kathleen Shields, supervisor of the immigration service's information unit. ''But by the time we get there, it will be the 21st.''
This year, about three-quarters of a million aliens will pass through the doors of the district headquarters, on 13 floors of the concrete and limestone Federal Building in lower Manhattan.
The immigration service estimates that if the new legislation becomes law, as many as 450,000 aliens could be eligible to apply for some sort of legal status in the district, which covers New York City, Long Island and seven upstate counties.
The immigration measure, the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill that is moving through Congress, would grant legal status to some illegal aliens and would try to stem further illegal immigration by penalizing employers who hire aliens who lack proper documents.
Agency officials say that they have taken steps in the last several years to streamline their operations and that they are making contingency plans to handle the surge of cases that would result from passage of the immigration bill.
''You can't sit back and wring your hands or leap out the window,'' said Charles C. Sava, director of the immigration service's New York district. ''You can't let the large numbers scare you.''
The New York district, including its branch offices, has a staff of 800, a 20 percent decrease from five years ago, when the immigration service reshuffled its resources to meet crises in districts with growing alien populations.
Aliens and their lawyers complain that the agency's operations are hampered by inefficiency - from a shortage of some of the most sought-after forms to regulations that bounce aliens from office to office. For the aliens, the sum total is often excruciating delay.
''It's an antiquated, 19th-century bureaucracy that has suffered from long neglect,'' said Arthur C. Helton, director of the Political Asylum Project of the New York-based Lawyers' Committee for International Human Rights. ''Its resources are inadequate to service such a mammoth clientele.''
Most days the agency has to tape hand-written signs in its first-floor information room advising aliens, ''No more tickets today.'' That means anyone who wants to do more than pick up a form will have to come back.

'I've Got to Go to Work'
''You think I got all the time to come here,'' one frustrated Nigerian man shouted the other day after an hourlong wait in line. When he got to the head of the line he was handed a form to fill out, one that traces the status of his petition for a ''green card,'' a document that indicates permanent residence.
''I filled out that form four times,'' he said. ''I've got to go to work. I got two kids. They've got to eat.''
Aliens who succeed in getting tickets from the information room can proceed to one of the upper floors where all business is transacted.
Many aliens say they find the application process frustrating and unnecessarily confusing. For example, one clerk told a Peruvian student who wanted to return home to visit his sick father but also insure his return to the United States: ''The 538 you submitted has no bearing on the I-20 now. And why didn't they pull the I-94?'' The student left in confusion.
One of the aliens' biggest complaints is the length of time it takes to get information on the status of their various petitions. Aliens must file petitions with the immigration service for almost all requests, such as visa extensions, replacements of lost cards, permission to work or go to school, or for permanent residence or citizenship.
Access to the 2.4 million files kept in the office's fourth-floor file room is often delayed by an outdated manual filing system. The files are stored on bookshelves instead of in filing cabinets. They have to be propped up with bookends, which increases the risk that they can fall out and be misplaced.
To save floor space, many of the stacks have to be pushed together, blocking access to 70 percent of the files at any given time. The stacks have to be moved every time access to closed shelves is needed.  ''Clerks sometimes have to wait 40 minutes for a new shelf to be opened,'' said Joseph Colon, one of the file supervisors.
Cardboard boxes and red plastic milk crates filled with files sit on the floor, on desks and in shopping carts, and there are thousands of slips requesting files, neatly bound in rubber bands to indicate the date of arrival.

'Off the Conveyor Belt'
''Ninety percent of the cases go through,'' said Allen E. Kaye, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers' Association, a 1,500- member specialty American Bar Association group. ''It's the ones that fall off the conveyor belt and disappear that worry me.''
One file that apparently disappeared belongs to Ashokchandra Shah, a 47- year-old Kenyan-born sales representative, who came to the United States in 1969 and applied for suspension of deportation when his British protected- person passport no longer gave him the right to return to Britain.
An immigration judge heard the case a year and a half ago, but Mr. Shah and his lawyer say they have been unable to receive any information about its outcome. Immigration officials say that while such delays occur occasionally, aliens in such cases are usually notified in several weeks.
''Anyone who wants to defect from Russia can stay here, but what about those of us who are already living here?'' asked Mr. Shah. ''They have no feeling for people at that place. 'Why are you so busy?' I ask them. 'For whom are you so busy?' ''

Files Turn Up
Immigration officials say there is no such thing as a lost file. ''People who talk about missing files are ignorant,'' said Mr. Sava. ''There's a certain processing time. If you're patient, it will come up.''
Replacement of documents is similarly problematic. Amrish Patel, a 32- year-old packing supervisor from Flushing who lost his wallet in September 1980, filed four applications for a replacement green card.
He wrote four times to the printing plant in Arlington, Tex., where green cards are prepared, which told him his papers had never been received. Almost four years, two lawyers and $500 later, his new green card arrived.

'You Just Fill Out New Forms'
''I never give a good word about that office,'' Mr. Patel said. ''You ask a question but they don't hear anything when you talk. You just get your picture taken again. You just get new fingerprints. You just fill out new forms.''
To get around what they see as problems of inefficiency and lack of access, some immigration lawyers have taken drastic steps. One routinely sues the immigration service when he cannot get action on a case.  Another frequently files an application under the Freedom of Information Act to get access to a client's file.
Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the immigration process is the excruciating wait that invariably comes after the forms have been filed.
When the Brooklyn branch office was reorganized a year ago, many of its examiners were detached for retraining, and 20,000 petitions for citizenship piled up. Aliens who inquired about the status of their claims were told their records were packed in boxes and couldn't be opened.
A month ago, the agency borrowed 5,000 square feet of space in another Federal building in downtown Manhattan, installed desks and shipped the files across the river. Fifteen criminal investigators - 10 percent of the entire investigatory staff - were assigned to the desk work. With a skeleton clerical staff, they are working feverishly to process the backlog by Labor Day.
The immigration service says that by October, all of its files will carry bar codes similar to the ones used on supermarket products. They will enable files to be checked out and located electronically.
The agency plans to install more than 100 I.B.M. computer terminals to provide instant identification of the alien, the status of his case, relevant dates and the location of the file. But an I.B.M. competitor, charging bidding violations, has successfully won a temporary order barring installation of the terminals.

New Center Is Opened
To increase output, three years ago the immigration service opened a Regional Adjudications Center in St. Albans, Vt.  In many cases, the center has dramatically cut the time needed to process various petitions. Because the files must be transfered there, however, the risk that they will be misplaced or lost is greatly increased.
The office has also farmed out 40 percent of its visa petitions to 16 posts on the Canadian border. And, in the lag time between international flight inspections, immigration officials at Kennedy International Airport now process cases that do not require interviews.
If an immigration bill passes, the experts say, it would place a tremendous additional burden on the office.

Contingency Plans Are Made
The bill would also penalize employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens, and increase the workload of criminal investigators.
While it is not at all certain that the bill will pass, the agency is making contingency plans to hire 175 more workers, some of them agency retirees, and to set up eight satellite offices to accept legalization applications. It hopes that voluntary agencies will play a major role in helping applicants prepare the complicated paperwork.
But many voluntary agency officals that help aliens are worried. ''That office is already overwhelmed,'' said the Rev. Peter Zendzian, director of the Catholic Migration and Refugee Office of the Diocese of Brooklyn. ''It would take some very heavy miracles to make the new law work.''

Immigration1.0-35372,COLORADO GOVERNOR SEEKS TO HALT ILLEGAL ALIENS,1983,8,new york times,By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT,section a,849.0,"For several years, Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado has been at the leading edge of a national drive to reform America's immigration laws, including cracking down on illegal aliens from Mexico.
For Mr. Lamm, a Democrat who has earned a reputation as a progressive politician, it is a position that has attracted no little controversy. Earlier this year, a suggestion by the Governor that illegal aliens be denied public health care benefits at a Denver city hospital brought a sharp rejoinder from some Hispanic politicians here.
They called him callous. Richard Castro, a state legislator from Denver, accused Governor Lamm of trying to ''make political points with racial bigots and nativists.''
Mr. Lamm says he is uncomfortable feuding with fellow Democrats, and fears that there are those who will, indeed, conclude that his support of immigration controls is racist in origin.

'A Matter of Common Sense'
''This is a highly emotional issue, and there are those who are going to question my motivation,'' the Governor said in an interview. ''But to me, it's a matter of common sense: The unemployed in this state, and across the nation, will never get jobs as long as we continue to take in twice as many immigrants as the rest of the world combined.''
Mr. Lamm, in arguing against what he described as ''demographic insanity,'' draws on perceptions that are especially sharp in Western states, where public policy often centers on the need to balance population growth against the availability of resources, especially water.
''Population is the ultimate environmental issue,'' the Governor said. ''And our immigration policy is making us poorer, not richer. It is dividing our wealth and resources.''
Although some Hispanic leaders have criticized Mr. Lamm's stand on immigration controls, so far he does not appear to have been hurt politically in Colorado, where about 12 percent of the state's population is Hispanic. Last fall, he was re-elected to a third four-year term as Governor with 68 percent of the statewide vote.

Ongoing Debate in Congress
The controversy here over the Governor's stand on immigration controls frames in part a larger, ongoing debate over the issue of immigration reform, which is now before Congress.
The bipartisan bill, sponsored by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky, seeks to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for illegal aliens to find work. Among other things the bill, which has already passed the Senate and is now being considered in the House, would make it a Federal crime to hire an illegal alien. It also would grant a broad amnesty to many of the illegal aliens already in the United States.
Some lawmakers, including Representative Patricia Schroeder, a fellow Democrat from Colorado, worry that the legislation will lead to discrimination against Hispanic Americans. But others argue, like Governor Lamm, that some kind of control is essential if natural resources are to be protected.
Edward Abbey, an Arizona author and environmentalist whose books have achieved a wide popular following, has irritated some of his own followers with his forceful arguments on behalf of immigration control, including stronger police measures to stop illegal aliens from Mexico.
''The doctrinaire liberal view tends to equate immigration control with discrimination, even racism,'' said Mr. Abbey, who describes himself as a liberal. ''And I resent that. Immigration can and should be controlled, not only for our own good, but for the better of Latin America as well.''

Extension of Amnesty Opposed
Mr. Lamm says he agrees in principle with the proposed legislation now before Congress, but strongly opposes a proposal in the House that would give amenesty to all illegal aliens who have lived continously in the United States since 1982. Under the Senate version of the bill, which the Governor favors, the amnesty would cover only those who have been here since 1980.
''Amnesty will do a lot for for all those people now living in a murky world of exploitation,'' Mr. Lamm said. But he added that a blanket amnesty for those who have been here since 1982 would be irresponsible, and said, ''The additional numbers that would be added to the social welfare rolls as a result of the extension will have a staggering fiscal impact on the states.''
Despite the opposition of some Hispanic legislators in Colorado, Mr. Lamm's staff says mail to his office runs strongly in favor of his position on immigration reform.
''I think the United States can continue to be generous in its immigration policies,'' said Mr. Lamm. ''But I know those decisions must be made by the U.S. Congress, rather than by Fidel Castro or some smuggler in Mexico.'' He was alluding to Mexicans who smuggle illegal aliens into the United States for profit, and to Mr. Castro's decision in April 1980 to allow thousands of Cubans, many of whom had been held in jails or mental institutions, to flee to the United States.

Immigration1.0-35761,CONFEREES AGREE ON BILL TO REVISE U.S. DISABILITY LAW,1984,9,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section 1,1105.0,"House and Senate conferees reached agreement today on a bill to overhaul the Social Security disability program, which has been in turmoil for more than a year.
The agreement would liberalize eligibility standards and make it harder for the Government to remove people from the rolls. Since 1981, the Government has reviewed 1.2 million disability cases and informed 490,000 beneficiaries that they would lose their benefits because they were no longer disabled. But more than 200,000 of those beneficiaries were put back on the rolls after they appealed.
House and Senate conferees make substantial progress in negotiations on comprehensive immigration bill, but they cannot agree on how to prevent job discrimination against US citizens and aliens legally in US; agree to eliminate important provision of Senate-passed bill that would have established overall limit on legal immigration and revised system for distributing visas to aliens; Rep Peter W Rodino Jr comments (M)
The reviews were conducted under a 1980 mandate from Congress.

Emotional Political Issue
Representative J. J. Pickle, Democrat of Texas, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, said in an interview today: ''We have reached an agreement on the disability bill and we hope to have it formalized by Monday. As a result of this agreement, the Social Security Administration will again be able to run a workable program.''
The operation of the disability program has become a highly charged political issue. Democrats asserted that the termination of benefits for thousands of disabled workers showed that the Reagan Administration was unfair. Republican members of Congress, deluged with complaints from constituents, joined Democrats in criticizing the Social Security Administration. Governors and Federal judges also put pressure on the Social Security Administration to change its policies.

48,000 Cases Pending
The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has refused to defend the Government in two dozen cases where it was trying to cut off disability benefits. He said the position of the Social Security Administration in those cases was unreasonable and indefensible.
Other United States attorneys have expressed dismay at the rapidly growing volume of Social Security cases. When a person is notified that he is no longer eligible for benefits, he may pursue an appeal within the Social Security Administration and, after exhausting this avenue, may file a lawsuit in Federal court to regain benefits. The United States attorneys normally defends the Government's position in court. Social Security officials said there were now 48,000 disability cases pending in Federal courts around the country.
A key element of the compromise reached by the conferees is an agreement that the Federal Government could not remove a person from the disability rolls unless it could show that his or her medical condition had improved.
Congressional aides said that the ''medical improvement'' standard was much closer to the one in the House bill than in its Senate counterpart. Under current law, the Government has cut off disability benefits for many people without demonstrating that their condition has improved.
The House of Representatives approved its version of the disability legislation by a vote of 410 to 1 on March 27. The Senate passed its bill unanimously, with 96 ayes, on May 22. Since then the two houses have had difficulty reconciling the bills, in part because the Reagan Administration objected to changes that would liberalize the eligibility criteria.
The conference agreement is still subject to approval by both houses of Congress. But Congressional aides said that approval was virtually certain, in view of the overwhelming margins by which the legislation was initially approved. To become law, a single version of the bill must be approved by both houses and signed by the President.
A Social Security official said the agency did not necessarily endorse every detail of the conferees' agreement but would support the overall compromise. Administration officials said they expected President Reagan to sign the bill if it got to his desk, although the White House has not made any formal public commitment to do so.

Benefit Cutoffs Suspended
Because of the uncertainty caused by differing standards imposed by Federal courts throughout the country, Margaret M. Heckler, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, temporarily suspended efforts to cut off disability benefits last April. The provisional resumption of benefits since then has been costing the Government $10 million a month more than the program currently costs, Social Security officials said. The program is expected to cost $18.5 billion in the current fiscal year.  The agreement on the disability bill was worked out by members of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. The key negotiators were Mr. Pickle and Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee. The bill, known as the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1984, is a freestanding piece of legislation that deals specifically with the problems of the disability program.
The conferees dropped a provision of the House bill that would have required the Social Security Administration to follow decisions issued by a United States Court of Appeals in the circuit where they were issued. The agency sometimes refuses to acquiesce in such rulings, on the ground that it may wish to reargue issues of law on which it has suffered adverse decisions.
Congressional aides said the confereees would issue a statement disapproving Social Security's practice of ''nonacquiescence'' in Federal court decisions. The statement would not be part of the language of the new bill, but would be expected to influence Social Security officials and Federal judges.

Standards for All Reviews
The statement says that the Social Security Administration should follow appeals court rulings except in situations where it has taken, or has a ''reasonable expectation and intention'' of taking, the steps necessary to appeal to the Supreme Court.
The standards in the bill would apply to all disability reviews done in the future and to many disability cases pending in Federal courts. Individual court cases and people in certified class actions would be sent back to the Social Security Administration for review under the new medical improvement standard, Congresisonal aides said.The bill appears to allay the fears of Administration officials who were worried that a nationwide class-action suit might be filed on behalf of all the people who had been improperly removed from the disability rolls.
The conference agreement provides that disability benefits and Medicare coverage should be continued for people who are pursuing administrative appeals of a decision to remove them from the disability rolls.

Immigration1.0-35391,CUBA OFFERS TALKS ON RETURN OF 'UNDESIRABLES',1983,6,new york times,Special to the New York Times,section a,1116.0,"Cuba has informed the United States that it is willing to discuss the return of some of the Cubans who came to this country illegally in 1980, but only as part of overall negotiations on ''normalization of migration'' between the two countries, Administration officials said today.
The officials said that Cuba, in a formal note delivered June 17, in effect spurned an official request from Washington last month that it take back unconditionally a few thousand ''undesirables'' from the 125,000 Cubans who came to this country in a boatlift from the Cuban port of Mariel in 1980. These were primarily Cubans who are now in American prisons or mental institutions.
The American note, sent May 24, said that until Cuba agreed to their return the United States would continue to refuse immigration visas in Havana to Cubans who did not have close relatives who were American citizens.
WASHINGTON, June 27 - Cuba has informed the United States that it is willing to discuss the return of some of the Cubans who came to this country illegally in 1980, but only as part of overall negotiations on ''normalization of migration'' between the two countries, Administration officials said today.'Unilateral Solution' Rejected
In its counterproposal, the Cuban Foreign Ministry told the American Interests Section in Havana that ''Cuba does not refuse to discuss establishment of conditions which would permit normalization of migration between both countries, including norms to follow, concerning persons who, having committed illegal acts in one country, travel illegally to the other.''
''If the United States is ready to discuss this on a basis of absolute equality and mutual respect,'' it said, ''the Cuban Government will accept such an initiative, but it rejects any attempt whatsoever at a unilateral solution in this field.''
A State Department official said that the Cuban note did not appear to be ''responsive'' to the American request, but that it was still being studied. He said he could not predict whether the United States would agree to negotiations on the whole subject of migration, as asked by the Cubans.

No Agreement at Talks
Such talks were held between Havana and the Carter Administration in December 1980 and January 1981, spurred by the Mariel exodus, but ended without agreement, State Department officials said. They said Cuba was insisting that all Cubans who return do so voluntarily and that Cuba have a veto on each one, a position unacceptable to Washington.
The Reagan Administration has had no formal negotiations with Cuba on any subject, but in 1981 and 1982 held some high-level discussions, mostly dealing with American efforts to persuade the Cubans to halt their aid to subversive movements in Central America.
The Cubans have regularly called for wide-ranging negotiations with the United States on normalizing overall relations, a proposal rejected by the Administration on the ground that Cuba was not serious in light of the situation in El Salvador and other countries. The Administration holds that Cuba has been fostering Communist-led guerrillas in El Savador. The most recent such proposal was made by Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez in a meeting in Havana earlier this month with Associated Press executives.

Threat to Salvador Noted
Privately, State Department officials have justified the refusal to discuss overall normalization by saying that Cuba would use such negotiations to try to demoralize Salvadorans by implying that the United States was striking a deal to end the war on terms unfavorable to the Salvadoran Government.
But Washington has not ruled out discussions with the Cubans on limited subjects such as immigration matters. For instance, in answer to American requests, Cuba last week turned over a list of the names of all recent hijackers and the prison sentences they have received. In 1973, the two countries signed an antihijacking treaty, which Cuba renounced in 1976. But in 1977 Cuba said it would continue to abide by the treaty's provisions.
The Cubans, in their note of June 17, accused the Reagan Administration of carrying out ''a permanently aggressive policy'' and said that during ''the whole Reagan Administration there have been no discussions on this problem'' of immigrants.
They also said that the United States had been unresponsive to their request in July 1980 that it return to Cuba ''criminals'' from the former Batista regime who fled to the United States in 1959, the year Fidel Castro took power.

Congressmen Urge Discussions
Besides the question of the return of ''undesirables'' to Cuba, there is also the problem of the backlog of would-be Cuban emigrants to the United States, including some 1,500 former political prisoners who had been promised entry to the United States in 1980.
Several members of Congress, including Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, the ranking members of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Policy, have urged the Reagan Administration to resume the discussions with the Cubans on immigration matters.
Wayne S. Smith, a retired Foreign Service officer, who served until 1982 as head of the American Interests Section in Havana and is now critical of the Reagan Administration's policies toward Cuba, said in a letter to The New York Times on June 15 that after President Reagan was inaugurated in January 1981 ''the Cubans indicated that there was more flexibility in their position and suggested new rounds of talks.''
''The Reagan Administration did not even bother to respond,'' he said.

U.S. Word 'Dishonored'
On the refugee question, Mr. Smith said that ''the Administration has refused to authorize visas for these divided Cuban families ever since it took office, turning a deaf ear to the pleas of the Interest Section in Havana that the only ones hurt by the refusal were the innocent applicants themselves, who had all their documentation and were eligible to receive visas to join their immediate families in the United States.''
The former political prisoners, he said, were a special category.  He said the Reagan Administration had ''turned its back on them, and in so doing, dishonored the word of the U.S. Government.''
Today, Mr. Kennedy said in a statement that it remained ''imperative and firmly in our national interest to deal with the Cuban immigration problem separately on its own terms and on an urgent basis.''
''If Cuba is willing to negotiate the question of reuniting loved ones with Cuban-American families, we should be willing to do so without further delay,'' he said.

Immigration1.0-35803,CUBAN-U.S. MEETING ON REFUGEE MEETING IS REPORTED,1984,7,new york times,By PETER KERR,section a,389.0,"Cuban and United States officials began discussions in New York yesterday about immigration issues, including the possible return of 1,000 Cuban refugees who came to the United States during the 1980 boatlift, a Reagan Administration source said last night.
The United States had been pressing Cuba intermittently for four years to take back criminals and mental patients among the 125,000 refugees who came by boat to Florida in 1980. About 1,100 Cubans considered inadmissable under American immigration law are being held at a Federal prison in Atlanta.
The secret discussions yesterday, at an undisclosed location in New York, would apparently be the first official negotiations between the United States and Cuba under the Reagan Administration. The discussions involved representatives of the State Department and the Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister, Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, according to United Press International.
A man who answered the telephone at the Cuban Mission to the United Nations, who identified himself as Arturo Mendos, confirmed that Mr. Alarcon de Quesada was in New York.
Spokesmen for the State Department would not confirm last night that the negotiations had begun. But in a press briefing earlier in the day, Alan Romberg, a spokesman for the department, said the Cubans had indicated that they were willing to move the timetable forward from November and that the Administration was expecting to begin talks ''sometime soon.''
The State Department said last month that the Cuban Government had agreed to open negotiations for normalizing relations, but at the time American officials said they thought the Cubans would wait until after the November elections. The officials said they believed that Havana was delaying the talks so as not to help President Reagan's re-election.
A year ago the United States said that until Cuba agreed to the return of unwanted refugees, the United States would not admit Cubans except for immediate family members of American citizens or of permanent American residents.
Last month, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson visited Havana and emerged from meetings with Fidel Castro having secured the release of 49 prisoners held in Cuba and a series of proposals to ease strained United States-Cuban relations, including an early start on immigration talks.

Immigration1.0-35015,DEBATE IS HEATED OVER IMMIGRATION,1982,12,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section 1,799.0,"The House of Representatives continued debate today on a comprehensive immigration bill, and supporters of the measure said its fate depended on the length of the current postelection session of Congress.
From 10:25 Thursday night to 12:25 this morning, the House debated the bill, which, according to a Senate report, ''represents the first comprehensive immigration reform effort in the United States in 30 years.''
Representative Edward R. Roybal, Democrat of California, complained, ''We took time during the day to debate a bill that deals only with dirt and wild animals and the wilderness of this nation, but late at night we debate a bill that affects millions of individuals.''
The House bill, like one passed by the Senate in August, tries to halt the influx of illegal aliens by forbidding employers to hire them. The bills would establish civil and criminal penalties for knowingly hiring illegal aliens, but they would also offer legal status to several million illegal aliens who entered the United States before 1980.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17 - The House of Representatives continued debate today on a comprehensive immigration bill, and supporters of the measure said its fate depended on the length of the current postelection session of Congress.More Than 3.5 Million Aliens
The number of people who would qualify for the amnesty is not known. The Census Bureau has estimated that there were 3.5 million to 6 million illegal aliens in the country in 1978. Many experts say the number has probably increased since then.
Congress is expected to adjourn in the next few days. Supporters of the immigration bill said a parliamentary tangle in the Senate over a stopgap spending bill and a proposal to increase the Federal gasoline tax, might give the House time to finish work on immigration.
Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky, the chief sponsor of the immigration bill, said, ''The only thing we have going for us is gridlock in the Senate.'' He added that supporters of the bill were confident they could answer any opponents' arguments if they had sufficient time.

Groups in Opposition
The eagerness of lawmakers to return home was thus a major obstacle to passage of the bill. In addition, Hispanic groups, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States and many growers of fruit and vegetables oppose the bill, especially the section establishing employer sanctions.
When the majority leader, Representative Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas, said that the bill would probably be debated again Saturday, there was hissing from members who believe that the legislation should not be taken up.
The Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., said, ''I'm not enamored of the bill myself, to be perfectly truthful.'' But he said he had allowed the bill to come up because he had received numerous requests from Attorney General William French Smith and from Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Rodino, Democrat of New Jersey, said he had been urging his colleagues to deal with the problem of illegal aliens for 10 years.  Since then, ''the problem has grown much worse,'' he said, adding, ''I do not believe this Government and the Congress should tolerate further delay.''
''Further delays,'' he said, ''will, in effect, regularize the current situation of an underground and exploitable segment of our population, beyond the protection of our laws.''
He defended the bill's amnesty provision, saying there was no way to ''round up millions of people and deport them without considering each individual's circumstances.''
Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California, who has spent much of his House career working on the civil rights of racial and ethnic minority groups, opposed the immigration bill. He said it ''accelerates the potential for increased violations of civil and constitutional rights.''
The possibility of racial discrimination is inherent in the employer sanctions, he said, and ''employer sanctions are the heart of the bill.''
Representative Dan Lungren, a California Republican, said discrimination was already a fact of life for illegal aliens living here as ''second-class citizens.'' He supported the bill and lamented the inability of the United States to control the movement of aliens across its borders. ''When a law is not enforced year after year after year, what does that do to our credibility?'' he asked.
Mr. Lungren, Mr. Rodino and Mr. Mazzoli all denied that the bill would encourage discrimination against Hispanic workers or members of other minority groups. But Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said virtually no Hispanic groups supported the bill.  ''Don't they know anything about their own problems?'' he asked.

Immigration1.0-35340,DEMOCRATS BAR ACTION IN HOUSE ON IMMIGRATION,1983,10,new york times,"By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to the New York Times",section 1,914.0,"House Democratic leaders have blocked a sweeping revision of immigration law, which the Administration has supported, out of fear that President Reagan would score a political coup by vetoing it.
Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts, conveyed that message to Attorney General William French Smith at a meeting in the Capitol on Thursday, according to Congressional sources and Justice Department officials. Mr. Smith vigorously denied that a veto was planned and pressed for House action on the measure, which the Senate approved in May.
C. Anson Franklin, a White House spokesman, denied today that the President intended to veto the bill. ''Any decision on the bill would be made on the basis of the merits of the bill and not on the basis of politics,'' Mr. Franklin said. He noted that President Reagan had strongly supported the measure.

Fate of Legislation in Doubt
The House Judiciary Committee approved the bill in May, and three other committees adopted amendments to it in June. But it has not been brought before the full House.
Whether or not the House Democratic leaders are correct about the veto threat, their continued perception of such a threat could mean that the legislation is dead.
The bill, which would impose fines and criminal penalties on employers who hired illegal aliens, has aroused intense concern among Hispanic groups, labor unions, civil libertarians, business organizations and farmers dependent on foreign workers.

Warning to Democrats on '84
Arnoldo S. Torres, executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, has warned that the bill would hurt the Democratic Party in the 1984 elections. He said there was ''a tremendous amount of animosity'' toward members of Congress who supported the bill.
A House Democratic leader who declined to be identified said the bill had been blocked because ''according to what the Hispanic caucus says, the Hispanics of America believe they are discriminated against badly in this bill.''
''They have heard that the President plans to veto the bill, and become a hero to Hispanic Americans,'' he added. The President has made a strong bid for support from Hispanic Americans, historically part of the Democrats' constituency.
Mr. O'Neill told the Attorney General that the Democratic leadership had ''irrefutable evidence'' that the President planned to veto the measure, the sources said. This evidence, which he would not describe in detail, apparently was based on information provided by the Congressional Hispanic caucus.
Mr. Smith strongly denied that the President intended to veto the bill. ''It isn't true,'' Mr. Smith said, according to Justice Department officials. He told the Speaker that the President would veto the bill only if it cost too much.
Justice Department officials said the Attorney General noted, ''We've been working on this issue since the beginning of the Administration.''
''The President would sign the Senate-passed version of the bill today if it was on his desk,'' the Justice Department officials quoted Mr. Smith as saying.

Assertion Called 'Preposterous'
Senator Alan Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, sponsor of the Senate bill, called the House leadership's assertion ''unbelievable'' and ''preposterous.''
''Bill Smith and I have been working on this for three years,'' he said.
The Reagan Administration has asserted that the bill would curtail the rising tide of illegal immigration. The employer sanctions are based on the premise that jobs are the main lure attracting illegal aliens.
Many Hispanic-Americans fear that the sanctions will increase job discrimination against them. They believe that employers will be so eager to avoid the sanctions that they will avoid hiring anyone who appears to be of Hispanic origin, including American citizens of Hispanic descent.
The bill also would offer legal status to illegal aliens who could prove they entered this country before a certain date, which would be Jan. 1, 1980, in the Senate bill and Jan. 1, 1982, in the House bill. Both bills would simplify the procedures for handling deportation cases and requests for asylum.

Verification at Issue
Under the Senate bill, employers would have to ask all job applicants for documents to verify that they were either citizens or aliens authorized to work in this country. This provision has aroused the concern of civil rights groups, who fear the creation of a ''national identity card.''
The House bill approved by the Judiciary Committee provides that an employer must verify the citizenship of job applicants only if the employer has been cited for a violation earlier.
The House Education and Labor Committee amended the bill to establish a presumption that if an employer hired an illegal alien without checking his identification papers, then the employer knew the alien was illegal. The committee also amended the bill to create penalties for any employer who discriminated against Hispanic workers or others because of their national origin.
The House Agriculture Committee voted to establish a ''guest worker'' program so aliens would be available when American citizens could not be found to harvest perishable commodities.
The Energy and Commerce Committee proposed an amendment authorizing Medicaid benefits for certain groups of legalized aliens: pregnant women, children under the age of 18 and those who need emergency medical services.

A Federal immigration judge, Sidney B. Majure, released the seven men and one woman from the Krome Detention Center here on their own recognizance. He said there was a ''unique community support'' for the Gautemalans and called them a ''very decent folk for whom I have a lot of empathy.''
The Indians have asked for political asylum in this country. Last month, before they asked for asylum, they were taken to the Guatemalan consulate here by the Immigration and Naturalization service. There, according to their attorney, they were questioned by Guatemalan officials outside the presence of Federal officials. The attorney said this violated immigration regulations.
MIAMI, March 11 - With the help of Mohawk Indians from New York State and from church groups, eight Guatemalan Indians have won release from Federal custody after fleeing violence in their country and entering the United States illegally.No Details on Incident
T.D. Martinez, deputy director of the Miami immigration office, said he did not yet have details about the reported incident at the consulate but would have a statement next week.
The Indians' case has aroused strong interest among American Indian and church groups. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Miami, Edward A.  McCarthy, asked for their release in a letter presented to Judge Majure. At today's hearing, Msgr. John McMann of West Palm Beach, the Rev. Frank O'Loughlin of Indiantown and Mohawk representatives from Akwesasne in northern New York urged the judge to release the Indians and pledged financial and social assistance for them.
Steven M. Tullberg, a lawyer from the Indian Law Resource Center in Washington, said Judge Majure's action was an ''important precedentsetting ruling on Guatemalan and Salvadoran refugees.''
''The State Department has not yet issued an opinion on their political asylum application,'' Mr. Tullberg said. ''There is no doubt that Guatemalan Indians are in at least as great danger from political strife as Haitians.''
Some 1,800 Haitians who entered this country illegally in 1981 were detained, some for more than a year, under a Reagan Administration policy aimed at discouraging such immigration. Most were freed by order of a Federal court.
Mr. Tullberg said he felt the experience of the Haitians had paved the way for today's release of the Guatemalans.  Ira Kurzban, who represented Haitians seeking political asylum, said many immigrants were still being held in detention centers in this country. He expressed pleasure at the Gautemalans' release and said the case ''points to a larger problem, the detention policy of this Administration, under which many persons seeking freedom are being kept in jail.''
The Indians freed from mmigration custody are members of the Mayan tribe speaking the Kanjobal language. There are about 250 Kanjobales in Florida picking vegetables and oranges, and perhaps as many as 3,000 in other parts of the country.
Mr. Tullberg learned about the Guatemalans' detention soon after most of them were arrested Jan. 25 and communicated with Jose Barreiro, managing editor of Akwesasne Notes, the official Mohawk publication. This week three Mohawk representatives came here, Mr.  Barreiro, Ray Cook and Geronimo Camposeco, who speaks Kanjobal.
Mr. Barreiro said American Indian tribes are ''very concerned'' about the problems of the Guatemalan refugees. He said a plan was under study to offer them land on Indian reservations.
The Guatemalans' stories tell of hard work, tragedy, newly found happiness, and then a scattering of their people.  According to the accounts, in the early 1970's a group of 50 Kanjobal families were eking out a meager existence in a village in the Cuchumatanes mountains, 50 miles from the Mexican border. Around 1974, several Maryknoll priests persuaded them to leave their high village and move to land three days' walk down the mountains. With the help of the priests, they grew coffee, corn and other crops and through the sale of coffee became self-sufficient.

'We Had Everything'
''We were as happy as we ever remembered,'' one Kanjobal said. ''We had everything we ever wanted of life.'' But the happiness did not last long. American aid resulted in the construction of roads near the village, and influential people in the lowlands wanted the newly accessible land. Army troops, the Indians said, intervened on the side of the new landlords. After hundreds of Indians were killed by the Army, the Kanjobales moved slightly higher on the mountains.
Soon the Indians became caught in the struggle between armed guerrillas and Government troops. There were atrocities by both sides, one Indian reported, and many villagers were killed, mostly by the troops.
Most of the Indians in Florida fled Gautemala last year, walking to Mexico. Several died. It is not clear how the Indians came to the United States, but it is assumed they were recruited by farm labor entrepreneurs.

Immigration1.0-35398,ESTIMATES OF ALIENS BAFFLE U.S.,1983,6,new york times,AP,section 1,203.0,"At least two million aliens are in the United States illegally, but the Census Bureau says it cannot figure out how many more there might be.
Other Government and private estimates on the number of illegal aliens in the United States range to 12 million, but a research paper released this week concluded the correct figure was probably below six million people.
WASHINGTON, June 18 (AP) -At least two million aliens are in the United States illegally, but the Census Bureau says it cannot figure out how many more there might be.
The study, conducted by Robert Warren and Jeffrey S. Passel, who are demographers for the Census Bureau, noted the bureau's count of illegal aliens must be considered the minimum number residing in the United States.
Officially, the bureau counted 2,047,000 illegal aliens in 1980.  The researchers also estimated that there were 5,965,000 aliens legally in the country on census day, April 1, 1980.
From there, Mr. Warren and Mr. Passell extrapolated, based on the Census Bureau's experience in miscounting other segments of the population. For example, having counted two million illegal aliens means that, if there are really six million illegal aliens in the United States, the bureau must have missed more than 60 percent of them.

Immigration1.0-35053,ETHNIC ARGENTINA: PASTA AND VERDI CONNECTION,1982,10,new york times,"By EDWARD SCHUMACHER, Special to the New York Times",section a,643.0,"From the rich pastas to the love for opera, Argentines are a Latin American people uniquely influenced by Italy.
Argentines are often described as Italians who speak Spanish, and they do even that with an Italian accent.  Italian immigrants flocked to Argentina as they flocked to the United States and long ago overtook the Spanish to become the largest ethnic group here.
BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 12 - From the rich pastas to the love for opera, Argentines are a Latin American people uniquely influenced by Italy.
In the process, they created an Italianate country acutely divergent from -and sometimes arrogant toward - the mixes of Indian, Spanish, Portuguese and African that characterize the rest of Latin America.

Most Immigrants From Italy
Intermarriage confounds any attempt to measure the extent of Italian ancestry among the 28 million Argentines.  But in the great growth period from 1869, when Argentines numbered 1.8 million people, to World War II, when they had multiplied to almost 15 million, some 55 percent of immigrants were Italian.
It was no surprise here that 26 prominent Argentines were listed as members of the powerful secret Italian Masonic lodge Propaganda 2, which was uncovered in a scandal in Italy last year.
The lodge's fugitive grand master, Licio Gelli, had a fraudulent Argentine passport when he was captured in Switzerland. He also reportedly was in hiding here for most of the 18 months that police around the world were looking for him on charges of international bank swindling.
During Argentina's war with Britain for the Falkland Islands, the Italian Government, citing the ties of kith and kin, was one of the first to break with the European Common Market's trade boycott of the South American country.

Italian Seeks to Mend Ties
Italy's Foreign Minister, Emilio Colombo, who visited here several weeks after the war's end in June, has been Argentina's broker and adviser in re-establishing relations with the Common Market and the rest of the West.
An Italian diplomat, though finding life familiarly comfortable for him here, stressed that Argentines are still politically and culturally immature compared with his countrymen.
And Roberto Cortes Conde, an economic historian who heads the Di Tella Institute for social research here, cautioned, ''It is intellectually dangerous to say there has been a repetition of national characteristics.''
But, he added, ''the Italians certainly had some influence.'' While a large number of the Italians who went to the United States came from Sicily and southern Italy, the bulk of the Italian immigrants to Argentina were from the more industrial and developed north. Although most were peasants, they brought with them a refined identification with the mainstreams of European culture. Opera, for example, is pervasive here. It is not unusual to hear strains of Verdi floating from radios in blue-collar neighborhoods on a peaceful Sunday.

Italians in All Classes
But many of the Italians also brought with them political attitudes that may have contributed to this country's political instability.
Italians, meanwhile, have successfully moved into all classes, but they are concentrated in the urban middle as shopkeepers, factory workers, bureaucrats and the like. Farmers and ranchers are mostly descendants of the Spanish, English and Welsh.
Perhaps a typical Italian immigrant is 41-year-old Liberato Pollio, a fishmonger who came from Sorrento, 15 miles southeast of Naples, 25 years ago.
''Politics I don't understand,'' he said recently in his shop, where pictures of Sorrento hang on the wall. ''But the style of life here is the same. And here, whatever a person wants to do, he just has to work and he will get it. I like it here.''

Immigration1.0-35467,FEAR OF AIDS HAS RED CROSS DISCOURAGING CERTAIN DONORS,1983,3,new york times,UPI,section b,285.0,"The American Red Cross says it will inform homosexual males, Haitian immigrants, drug users and others considered at high risk of carrying a dangerous disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, that they should not donate blood.
The organization acted in response to Public Health Service recommendations announced Friday by Edward Brandt, assistant secretary of Health and Human Services.
WASHINGTON, March 6 (UPI) -The American Red Cross says it will inform homosexual males, Haitian immigrants, drug users and others considered at high risk of carrying a dangerous disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, that they should not donate blood.
''The American Red Cross said that all of its blood centers will be providing potential donors with information on acquired immune deficiency syndrome,'' the group announced. ''It will also inform high-risk groups that they should refrain from making donations until more is known about AIDS.''
The disease, which diminishes the body's natural immunity defenses, leaves victims susceptible to rare forms of cancers, respiratory and other diseases.

Fatality Rate Over 40 Percent
The present fatality rate is above 40 percent and scientists fear it will go higher, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Of the more than 1,000 cases reported, not one of the victims has recovered from the illness.
Although there is no conclusive scientific evidence that the infectious agent is transmitted by blood, health officials say 15 cases may be linked to the blood transfusions and several hemophiliacs have died after receiving transfusions.
The Public Health Service said ''high risk'' donors included patients diagnosed with AIDS, sexual partners of AIDS patients, persons with AIDS symptoms, sexually active homosexual or bisexual men with multiple partners, Haitian entrants to the United States, current or past abusers of intravenous drugs, and sexual partners of individuals at high risk for AIDS.

Immigration1.0-35812,FEART AND SKEPTICISM ACROSS THE BORDER,1984,7,new york times,By RICHARD J. MEISLIN,section 4,881.0,"If illegal Mexican immigrants and the people who study them are correct, the immigration legislation now being considered by Congress would not regain control of the United States border so much as it would offend nearly everyone south of it. The Mexican Government has had little officially to say about the legislation, which was approved last week by the House of Representatives. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry merely warned that the measure could ''seriously undercut and injure the human and labor rights of Mexican workers.'' But business, labor and peasant organizations have been unanimous in condemning the proposed law. It has been called racist, repressive, economically devastating and another instance of the wealthy and omnipotent United States turning its back on less fortunate neighbors.
The vision that has been created here is one of massive deportations, with accompanying social and economic disarray, as illegal immigrants flood back across the border to a country already seriously short of jobs. The president of the Confederation of Industrial Chambers, Jacobo Zeidenweber, predicted that the legislation ''will cause very major damage'' to Mexico's economic, political and social systems.
Among those who study Mexico's illegal immigrants, however, and among the immigrants themselves, the belief that the law would put an end to the flow of undocumented workers is dismissed as politically expedient fantasy. Laws imposing penalties against employers who knowingly hire illegal workers have been on the books in California and several other states for years, with little effect. Experts do not expect American citizens to replace illegal workers in the low-paying jobs most of them would vacate. So long as the demand for cheap labor continues, they predict, so will the flow of undocumented workers.  ''There is nothing in the bill that would be different from sanctions that already exist,'' said Dr. Jorge Bustamante, director of Mexico's Center for Border Studies of Northern Mexico. The incentive to cross - the need to feed oneself and one's family - has been far stronger than the legal barriers. Mexicans of all social classes demonstrate a remarkable facility for skirting their own country's laws when their economic interests are involved. There is little reason to think they would cease to skirt someone else's. Unemployment is estimated at more than 10 percent and underemployment, above 40 percent. The minimum wage is $4.41 a day and real income is crumbling in the face of continuing inflation. ''You're talking about one of the world's highest-wage countries in juxtaposition with a middle-developed country that nonetheless has one of the lowest wage scales,'' said Wayne A. Cornelius of the University of California's Center for United States-Mexico Studies. ''There's simply no legal or police remedy to that.'' $1 Billion ContributionMassive deportations are unlikely, Mr. Cornelius said, since the legislation covers only the newly hired, not illegal aliens already working in the country, and applies only to companies with more than four employees. Nevertheless, the bill may do some damage to Mexico, researchers said. Higher-paying job opportunities for border- violators are likely to dry up, cutting earnings and thus the money illegal immigrants can send or bring back to their families. They now contribute an estimated $1 billion a year, one of Mexico's largest sources of foreign currency.
Problems are also likely to increase, at least temporarily, in Mexican border towns, as workers wait to see if the coast is clear before trying to cross. Northern border cities have already had their resources strained by spectacular growth and this is likely to worsen. While the growing number of ''in bond'' border assembly plants have provided jobs for some of the new arrivals, wage scales are low, making them only a short- term alternative for most Mexicans seeking the comparative riches available across the border.
The measure offers a major concession to illegal immigrants - amnesty for those who can prove they have lived continuously in the United States since January 1982 but for many Mexicans this will be of little help. A large number cross back and forth with the seasons. Dr. Bustamante estimates that there are 500,000 illegal Mexicans in the United States most of the year and that the total rises to 1.5 million to 1.75 million for the summer and fall harvests. Also, many of those who have been hiding from the authorities and working in the underground economy are unlikely to have collected authentic documentary evidence of their stay in the United States.
As the House and Senate prepare to go to conference to resolve their differences on the legislation, the flow shows no sign of letting up. In Tijuana a few days ago, dozens of Mexicans could be seen trekking across a parched, rock-strewn field near the airport to a point where they would hide out until nightfall, waiting for their chance to slip by the border patrol and into the United States. Across the road at a little shop, a tortilla maker told a visitor he had watched the sequence repeated nearly every day for 15 years. ''There's nothing for them to do here,'' he said. ''They'll never stop them from going.''

Immigration1.0-35303,"FIGURES SHOW A SPURT, THEN A DROP, IN DENIALS OF ASYLUM FO",1983,12,new york times,By WAYNE KING,section 1,633.0,"R POLES



Statistics released by the Immigration and Naturalization Service have shown that denials of political asylum to Polish exiles sharply increased three years ago, but have eased slightly this year.
In 1980 Congress revised the law governing political asylum to eliminate preference to applicants from Communist countries, including Poland. Since that time, the number of Polish exiles seeking asylum here has grown dramatically because of upheavals in Poland, including outlawing the union Solidarity and imposing of martial law.
Immigration and Naturalization Service statistics show that denials of political asylum to Polish exiles sharply increased three years ago, but have eased slightly in 1983; reports it rejected 900 applications and approved 261 in fiscal 1983 (M)
In the past fiscal year, for example, the Immigration and Naturalization Service reported that it rejected 900 applications for political asylum from Polish exiles and approved 261.
The figures, which cover the period from Oct. 1, 1982, through Sept. 31 of this year, were reported this week in response to assertions from groups supporting Polish exiles in this country that rejection rates ran as high as 85 percent.
The figures reported by the immigration service show a rejection ratio of 77 percent.
Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the immigration service in Washington, said the rejections for October and November totaled about 62 percent.

Backlog of Applications
Mr. Jervis said earlier that a perception of stepped up rejections in the past two months might have resulted from an effort within the immigration service to clear a backlog of applications for asylum.
In the fiscal year 1982, more than 90 percent of applications for asylum from Polish nationals were rejected, he reported, with 1,095 denied and 102 granted.
In the fiscal year 1981, 571 applications were denied, and 90 approved, a rejection ratio of 86 percent.
But in the fiscal year 1980 243 applications were approved and 74 were denied, a rejection ratio of 23 percent.
The reversal resulted from a change in the law on asylum in May 1980. Before that, applicants for asylum from Communist countries, such as Poland, and certain areas of the Middle East were given special consideration, and their applications ''were viewed as having an almost automatic asylum grant,'' Mr. Jervis said.
He said that 1,843 applications from Poles are pending. In addition, most of those whose applications were rejected at an initial hearing have appealed, asserting that they would be in danger if they returned to Poland.
However, he said that because some appeals fall under the jurisdiction of the Justice Department, precise figures on the disposition of appeals are not readily available.

Appeals Can Cause Delays
Although foreign nationals whose applications for asylum in this country are rejected are routinely ordered to leave within 15 days, appeals can delay deportation for years.
In addition, Polish exiles now in this country are exempt from deportation proceedings under special status granted by the immigration service because of unpredictable conditions in Poland.
That special status was first granted on a temporary basis, for six months, in 1981 and has been renewed each six months since then. The current six- month extension expires at the end of this month, and no announcement has been made on whether it will again be extended.
Groups supporting asylum for Polish nationals have stepped up pressure for a higher acceptance ratio.
In August, two professional associations made up of Polish-American lawyers and doctors petitioned both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee for hearings on the immigration service's handling of asylum applications from Polish exiles.
The Senate has denied the request, and no action has been taken in the House because of the recent death of the committee chairman, Clement J. Zablocki, Democrat of Wisconsin.

Immigration1.0-35448,FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Fleeing China,1983,4,new york times,By Richard Haitch,section 1,229.0,"Two Chinese on cultural missions to the United States defected last year and asked this country to let them live here. One was Hu Na, the 19-year-old star tennis player who sought political asylum in July and received it last week amid widely publicized protests by China.
Two Chinese on cultural missions to the United States defected last year and asked this country to let them live here.The other defector was Ling Jian-wei, a 24-year-old ballet dancer, about whom little has been heard since he quit a ballet competition in June in Jackson, Miss.
Mr. Ling did not seek political asylum; he asked for permanent residence based on his occupation as a dancer.  His request has also been granted, but China has not made an issue of his case, according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. ''I received no contact from the Chinese Government, and I'm not aware of any other contacts,'' says William J.
Chambers, the district immigration director in Dallas who processed Mr. Ling's application.  Mr. Ling, who now spells his name John Wey Ling, is principal dancer with the City Ballet in Fort Worth, Tex., and is on the faculty of the Southwest Ballet Center in Fort Worth, says the director of both organizations, William Martin-Viscount. In addition Mr. Ling performs independently.
''He just got back from London,'' Mr. Martin-Viscount says, ''and I know he's also negotiating a contract to go to Hong Kong very soon.'' ''He's sought after,'' the ballet director says.

Immigration1.0-35793,"FOR ALIENS, RULES, FORMS AND MORE RULES",1984,7,new york times,,section b,628.0,"The ''green card,'' the most important document an alien can possess, is not green, but white with red and blue lettering.
That is just one of the many puzzles that aliens visiting and living in the United States encounter in the world of immigration rules, forms, procedures and options.
There are four basic classifications of aliens, each of which has its own rules. These are the groups:
ILLEGAL ALIENS - These are foreigners who have no entry visa and enter the country by avoiding inspection. They are deportable at any time.

NONIMMIGRANTS - These are aliens temporarily admitted for a specific purpose and period of time that depends on the nature of the visit.
In almost all cases, they must obtain a temporary visa before arrival and carry an ''I-94'' form, an arrival-departure record issued upon entry and endorsed to show their status - whether student or diplomat or temporary worker or tourist. Federal immigration regulations bar many groups from entering the United States, including prisoners, lepers, homosexuals, polygamists, prostitutes, syphilitics and stowaways.
It is possible to change from one nonimmigrant status to another, such as from a student to a temporary worker, but the procedure can be complex and time-consuming.  Among nonimmigrants who can apply for the right to work in the United States are students who have finished school and are approved for practical training in their field. Others, such as aliens who come to the United States for a specific job or are engaged to a United States citizen, are authorized to work on arrival.

IMMIGRANTS - These are aliens who have been granted permanent residence in the United States. They can remain indefinitely, own property, work and travel inside and outside the United States as long as they comply with the laws relating to alien registration and change of address. They are required to carry alien registration-receipt cards, better known as green cards, at all times.
Certain nonimmigrants may qualify for permanent residence. They include children, brothers and sisters of citizens; spouses and children of permanent residents; talented professionals and skilled and unskilled labor in short supply.
The process of getting residency can be daunting. For workers, for example, an ETA750 labor certification must be submitted by the prospective employer to the State Labor Department to determine if the alien worker is needed.
If so, the prospective employer files visa-petition form I-140 with the immigration service. If the worker quota is not filled, the application proceeds. The nonimmigrant files an I-485 petition for change to immigrant status, a biographical information form, a birth certificate, two photographs and a fingerprint chart.
If all the paperwork is in order, an interview is scheduled for about three months later. Permanent residency can be approved on the day of the interview.

REFUGEES - Refugees are aliens who have been granted asylum for their political beliefs. The applications go through an entirely different screening process - by both the immigration service and the State Department.
Refugees usually are granted the right to work in the United States. A year later, they are called in and interviewed for permanent residency. Permanent residents who live in the United States for five years - three if married to a citizen - can petition for naturalization as United States citizens.
The New York district immigration office, at 26 Federal Plaza, is open Monday through Friday, except holidays, from 7:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Forms can be ordered by calling (212) 349-5286. For information about immigration matters, a selection of 48 different tapes can be heard by calling (212) 206-6500.

Your March 14 editorial ''Nervous Nellies at the Gates'' inspires me to write not only in affirmation of the sentiments set out therein about the offensiveness of denying permission to visit the United States on grounds of ''unwanted political affiliations'' but to make a fervent plea about another issue concerning present exclusions practiced under provisions of the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act.
Many Americans do not realize that this legislation, product of the hysteria of the McCarthy era, contains a provision denying the granting of visitors' visas to aliens who are identified, by themselves or others, as homosexuals.
Your March 14 editorial ''Nervous Nellies at the Gates'' inspires me to write not only in affirmation of the sentiments set out therein about the offensiveness of denying permission to visit the United States on grounds of ''unwanted political affiliations'' but to make a fervent plea about another issue concerning present exclusions practiced under provisions of the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act.
Considering the changes which have taken place in the state of our knowledge, as constrasted with the prevailing ignorance of the 1950's, it is discouraging and deplorable to realize that the enlightened representatives and senators who have introduced legislation to repeal this section of the McCarran-Walter Act have been thwarted by a combination of indifference and timidity on the part of their fellow legislators.
Nothing could be more absurd than to justify continuation of this obsolete proviso of the immigration law. Still, it will be invoked until the Congress repeals it, and it affects many in a deeply painful manner without inspiring the type of protest embodied in your fine editorial triggered by Mrs. Allende's exclusion.
Waivers are not what is needed here; action to wipe this legislation from the books is the remedy that we should demand.

Immigration1.0-35935,GRANT TO JERSEY CITY INSTITUTE TO AID 'UNDOCUMENTED' ALIENS,1984,2,new york times,By PAMELA MARGOSHES,section 11nj,890.0,"JERSEY CITY

T HE International Institute of Jersey City has received a one-year, $12,000 grant to provide low-cost, legal-aid services for ''undocumented'' aliens, and to compile information for a study on nonprofit, public-interest law firms and clinics that deal specifically with immigration issues.
For indigent clients, the legal aid would be free.
Undocumented aliens are those who entered the United States without having gone through standardized immigration procedures.
The grant, from the Fund for New Jersey, a foundation in East Orange, will allow the institute to hire a paralegal aide to assist undocumented aliens in the following areas of immigration law:
- Political asylum claims.
International Institute of Jersey City receives one-year, $12,000 grant to provide low-cost, legal aid services for undocumented aliens and to compile information for study on non-profit public interest law firms and clinics that deal specifically with immigration issues (M)
- Labor certification documentation.
- Relative petitions (for people with families already in the United States).
- The right to public education for children of undocumented aliens (a right recently reiterated by a United States Supreme Court ruling).
- The preparation of all necessary documents (affidavits, supportive documentation and briefs, etc.) for the adjudication of cases now pending before the Immigration and Naturalization Service and for cases to be presented to it.
The small fees charged for legal services would be directly funneled into the legal-defense project.
''The undocumented have certain constitutional rights,'' said Phyllis Bianca, the institute's attorney. ''They are entitled to administrative hearings and to legal representation.''
Robert Corman, executive director of the fund, said:
''This is a unique grant, I believe, in the State of New Jersey, and we're really excited about it.
''This is a new area for us. In the past, we've supported groups dealing with environmental issues, the homeless and the support of farmworkers in South Jersey, but we've never gotten into the area of legal defense for the undocumented.
''I do believe that it's also a first for the state because I called many of the public-interest agencies, including the American Civil Liberties Union, and none of them were doing anything to protect the legal rights of the undocumented.
''We're hoping that the institute will be able to set up a kind of information base with this money. We do understand that this is a controversial area.''
The institute is part of a network of 33 ethnic service organizations affiliated with the American Council for Nationalities Service. It is the only International Institute in New Jersey, a state that, according to 1980 Census figures, has more than 700,000 foreign-born people.
The nonprofit institute serves such disparate groups as Vietnamese and other Indochinese, Russians, Afghans, Chinese, Poles, Haitians, Egyptians, Iranians and Hispanic people. It has an annual budget of about $300,000 and receives funds from the United Way, the Federal Government and charitable contributions. It has 11 full-time staff members.
In its 65 years in Jersey City, the institute has provided resettlement services, classes in English, social and translation services and career counseling. It continues to provide these services.
It also functions as an information bureau on immigration patterns in the state and on the characteristics, history and institutions of ethnic groups in New Jersey. In addition, it makes referrals for people seeking to link up with other organizations that work with ethnic groups.
''We were delighted to receive the grant because this enables us to expand our service capacity,'' said Dr. Nicholas V. Montalto, the institute's executive director. ''Although this is a rather controversial area, we are pleased to be able to provide services for this population.''
Dr. Montalto explained that the grant would not mean that the institute would focus exclusively on undocumented aliens.
This grant, he said, finances only one activity of the institute, which will continue to provide a full range of services to all immigrants and refugees.
The International Institutes began at the turn of the century as immigrant service agencies set up by the Y.W.C.A. The first institute was organized in 1910 in New York City.
For the legal-aid project, undocumented aliens will be reached through advertisements in the ethnic press and word of mouth.  ''Our institute has an excellent word-of-mouth reputation among the ethnic community,'' Dr. Montalto said. ''We don't anticipate problems in reaching out to the undocumented.''
According to Dr. Montalto, it is difficult to correctly assess the number of undocumented aliens in New Jersey.
''But,'' he said, ''I heard estimates that, for example, there are as many as a million Salvadorans in the United States now, and there may be as many as 20,000 in New Jersey.''
On March 10, the institute will be the sponsor of a ''career fair'' in Jersey City for refugee professionals. ''Mentors'' - American and foreign- born professionals in the fields of engineering, teaching, medical services and other areas - will conduct workshops to familiarize the refugees with the vicissitudes of the labor market.
Anyone interested in further information about either the career fair or other activities at the institute can call Nancy Long, the program director, at (201) 653-3888.
The International Institute is at 880 Bergen Avenue and is open weekdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.

Immigration1.0-35907,GUATEMALAN FAMILY REACHES REFUGE,1984,3,new york times,,section 1,538.0,"With church bells resounding over the snow- covered landscape and hundreds of people looking on, 12 Benedictine monks welcomed a family from Guatemala to the sanctuary of a hilltop monastery here today.
The seven members of the family, who entered the United States illegally and used the assumed name of Excot, arrived this morning with a caravan of 28 cars ending an eight-day journey from Chicago. As the Excots stepped out of their van, all except a 7-month- old baby, Inez, wore bandanas to shield their faces. With photographers pressing close, the family was embraced by the monks of Weston Priory.
Benedictine monks at Weston Prior, Vermont, welcome Guatemalan family of 7, using assumed name of Excot, which entered US illegally and was escorted from Chicago by 28-car caravanof supporters, who oppose US policies on immigration and Central America; family illustrated, wearing masks to protect identities; Excot was farmer who said he was sought by Govt forces for teaching villagers to read (S)
The caravan was organized by the Chicago Religious Task Force on Central America, an interdenominational group that has helped establish 110 sanctuaries across the country for refugees from Central America. While the family was traveling from Chicago, the group held rallies in several cities to dramatize opposition to the Government's policies on immigration and on Central America.
After their arrival in Weston, Felipe and Elena Excot and their five children joined about 500 well-wishers in a barn festooned with streamers and enclosed with sheets of plastic against the cold.
The monks led the gathering in a ceremony of song and prayer with the family, still masked, seated in a semicircle in the front of the room.
The Excots, in Spanish, told of atrocities suffered at the hands of the military Government of Guatemala.
By offering public sanctuary to the family and other refugees who might follow, the monks are defying Federal law and risk a penalty of five years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
Over 10 years, the monks have traveled to Mexico several times, visiting with refugees there and returning with stories of persecution and murder. They decided to declare a sanctuary to make known their difference with United States policy. One of the monks, Brother Philip, said they also wanted to provide a shield against publicity for the Excot family.
Brother John, another monk, said, ''What we are doing is a demand and a consequence of our faith.''

Immigration Officials' View
Immigration officials showed no interest in intercepting the Excot caravan.
William J. Dempsey, deputy director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service for the district that includes Vermont and Maine, said the agency's highest priority was apprehending employers of aliens who are in this country illegally rather than bothering with the relatively small number of illegal aliens who have sought sanctuary with church groups.
In the gathering at Weston was the Rev. Daniel Jensen, a Maryknoll priest who hid Mr. Excot in Guatemala City three years ago. Mr. Excot was a farmer who said he had been sought by Government forces because he had been teaching villagers to read.
Father Jensen, who said he left Guatemala after receiving death threats, said of the Excot family, ''If they're deported, they'd be killed.''
A person who traveled with the caravan quoted Mrs. Excot as saying upon her arrival in Weston, ''I am very, very happy, and it's perhaps the saddest day of my life.'' It was explained that she was expressing her grief for the country she had left behind.

Immigration1.0-35464,GURU OF BIG OREGON COMMUNE FACING DEPORTATION,1983,3,new york times,"By JUDITH CUMMINGS, Special to the New York Times",section a,1109.0,"When the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh goes out for an afternoon drive in one of his shiny Rolls-Royces, his followers wonder how much time the Indian guru has left here to tool around these scrubby desert hills.
The townspeople of Antelope are wondering about that, too. ''If he would just leave, all those people down there on that ranch would eventually just go away,'' said Mona Reynolds, the former town recorder of Antelope, a community of fewer than 100 people whose government is now controlled by the Bhagwan's people.
The Bhagwan, whose name means ''the blessed one'' in Hindi, is facing a deporation threat. He left his ashram, or community of Hindus, in Poona, India, and came to the United States in 1981 on a tourist visa. According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Portland, he is not entitled to the status of a ''religious worker'' and should be declared deportable, along with his mother, 70-year-old Saraswatabai Jain, who followed him to America.
RAJNEESHPURAM, Ore. - When the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh goes out for an afternoon drive in one of his shiny Rolls-Royces, his followers wonder how much time the Indian guru has left here to tool around these scrubby desert hills.Abandoned Commune in Jersey
There has been friction in this desolate countryside since the guru's followers abandoned a commune in Montclair, N.J., 18 months ago and set themselves up on a ranch that they called Rancho Rajneesh, on barely arable land in central Oregon.
Residents of Antelope, 20 miles north of the ranch, said they were at first amused by the commune dwellers, who wear crimson-hued clothes, lean toward encounter therapies, indulge in what some call free sex and pride themselves on combining the profit motive with environmental concern. Antelope's attitude changed when the group, which has grown to 800 members, took political control of the town.
Last year, the guru's followers won the right to incorporate part of their 64,000-acre ranch as Rajneeshpuram, Oregon's newest city.  The Bhagwan's disciples, most of whom are educated and affluent young Americans and Europeans, say the immigration agency's position amounts to religious discrimination. Not even a successful deportation action, they said, would make them leave the ranch.

'No Intention of Leaving'
''We have invested more than $35 million here,'' said Sunshine, a former Californian in her mid-20's who is a spokesman for the group.  ''We have no intention of leaving.''
The Indian mystic sought permanent resident status on the ground that he was a religious leader and had diabetes, serious allergies and other health problems that kept him from returning to India. The immigration service turned down his request Dec. 21, saying he was unable to perform as a religious worker and he had made false statements about his health.
After a protest by the Bhagwan's lawyers about not being given evidence against their client, Robert E. Krueger, regional director of the immigration agency in Portland, reopened the case to let them reply. ''It was a technical error,'' he said. ''We didn't give them copies'' of the evidence. ''We discussed it with them and thought that would be enough.''
Recently a Federal district judge in Portland gave the guru until March 28 to prepare his reply.

'Nobody Likes a Living Buddha'
The guru, who could be seen driving serenely along a dusty road with a young woman at his side, would not comment on his situation.  According to his top aide, Ma Anand Sheela, a woman of Indian extraction, he talks regularly only to her and has not spoken in public in more than two years.
She said the efforts to deport him started because he posed a threat, ''because nobody likes a living Buddha or a Christ that is a threat to the social or economic system.'' The guru's disciples say they have 300,000 followers worldwide. ''He is not going to be deported,'' the Bhagwan's aide said. ''We have created a beautiful city for him here. There is no reason for him to leave.''
The group has also begun to invest money in Portland, buying a residential hotel, a bakery and a nightclub, which they named Zorba the Buddha.
The Bhagwan earned a reputation abroad as ''India's free-love guru.'' Ma Anand Sheela and other top lieutenants say the Bhagwan's teachings promote a philosophy not of sex carried to extreme but, rather, sex without guilt. About all a casual visitor sees is that people here hug more often than people at, say, a suburban shopping center elsewhere.

Blessed to Be Rich
The Bhagwan also teaches, not unlike America's Reverend Ike, that it is not more blessed to be poor. Thus his followers put their labor toward making the ranch self-sufficient with farming and other enterprises.
Sheela, as she is called, drives a silver-blue Mercedes-Benz with a bumper sticker that says, ''Jesus Saves, Moses Invests, Bhagwan Spends.''
Disciples say the guru has 27 Rolls-Royces on the ranch, gifts from around the world. A few months ago they released to the press a photograph of the cars lined up. That was essentially done for shock value, Sunshine said, but there was a practical angle.
''The 27 Rolls-Royces make a great investment scam,'' she said, adding that the commune's investment corporation regularly made a profit reselling the cars the guru had driven.
The red-clad newcomers, who wear pictures of the guru around their necks, have their supporters among the local people. ''They've got the same rights as anybody else, that's the way we all feel,'' said Rick Cantrell, a commissioner of Wasco County, which includes part of Rancho Rajneesh. Last year, Mr. Cantrell, a former county judge, cast a favorable vote in the 2-to-1 decision that let the city of Rajneeshpuram be incorporated.
Mr. Cantrell said his relationship with the group caused him to be charged with conflict of interests after he sold cattle valued at $17,000 to the group just before the vote. The complaints were dismissed by the State Government Ethics Commission.
Mrs. Reynolds's husband, Loren, and other residents of Antelope said they had been ''overwhlemed'' by the newcomers' aggressiveness.  This year, changes by the commune-dominated government have caused water rates to increase to $40 a month from $10, Mr. Reynolds said.  His ''Keep Oregon Green'' buttons reveal his feelings against ''the Reds.''
He also said the rate of assessments for the Fire Department rose from $1 to $4. ''And they want to improve the streets so they can run big trucks over them,'' he said. ''The roads were just fine before they got here.''
Frances Dickson, whose husband, Bill, is the town postmaster, likened the commune to ''a working country club for the rich.'' ''These are very affluent people, but they can't cope,'' she said.  ''They love it down there because they don't have to make any decisions - not even what color clothes to wear.''

Immigration1.0-35392,HAITIAN PAUSED TO GIVE AID AND LOST ON A POINT OF LAW,1983,6,new york times,AP,section a,318.0,"A young Haitian refugee who stayed on a United States beach to help fellow victims of a shipwreck instead of fleeing may now be deported for doing what he thought was right, his lawyer says.
The problem arises because, under United States immigration law, aliens arrested after entering the country have more rights than those stopped at the border.
The refugee in this case, Marcelin Pierre, 23 years old, was a passenger aboard the vessel La Nativite, which sank in heavy seas off Hillsboro Beach in October 1981. Its passengers were thrown into the surf and 33 died.
MIAMI, June 27 (AP) - A young Haitian refugee who stayed on a United States beach to help fellow victims of a shipwreck instead of fleeing may now be deported for doing what he thought was right, his lawyer says.
Mr. Pierre cannot swim but made it safely to shore, where he and some of the other survivors began dragging back bodies so they would not be carried away by the tide, and tended to fellow survivors.
''Instead of running away, he submitted himself to the cause of humanity,'' Mr. Pierre's lawyer, Burton Young, said last week. ''I don't think he should be punished for doing what is right.''
After two hours of argument, Judge Jose Simonett, of immigration court disagreed with Mr. Young. Because Mr. Pierre did not intend to evade immigration officials, Judge Simonett said, he never achieved entry.
The ruling is in accord with earlier decisions on Haitians who have arrived near or on Florida shores by boat. ''A landing is not synonymous with an entry,'' Judge Simonett said.
The judge, however, did agree to put off further proceedings to expel Mr. Pierre until Mr. Young could appeal.  After being taken into custody by immigration agents, Mr. Pierre was confined along with 1,000 other Haitians at the Krome Avenue refugee camp. The Haitians were ordered released by a Federal judge last year, and Mr. Pierre found work at a furniture store in Opalocka.
''I want to stay in Miami,'' he said.

Immigration1.0-35088,HOUSE PANEL PROGRESSING ON IMMIGRATION BILL,1982,9,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section a,527.0,"The House Judiciary Committee made slow but steady progress today in writing a bill to overhaul the nation's immigration laws.
The panel approved a major amendment guaranteeing access to the courts for aliens, including those who entered the United States illegally. The Senate last month passed an immigration bill, strongly supported by the Reagan Administration, that would have restricted access to the courts for many aliens seeking asylum or challenging orders for their expulsion from this country.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 - The House Judiciary Committee made slow but steady progress today in writing a bill to overhaul the nation's immigration laws.
The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Representative Peter W.  Rodino Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said that such restrictions were unacceptable, and his colleagues agreed with him.
Those who come to this country seeking refuge from persecution must have an opportunity to present their claims to a Federal court if their applications are rejected by the Justice Department, Mr. Rodino said. Otherwise, he said, ''we become accomplices to the imprisonment, torture and murder that await them upon their return to their home country.''

Amendment Wins Praise
The amendment, offered by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, won praise from the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and Hispanic groups, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
Those groups had all been extremely critical of the restrictions contained in the Senate bill. The civil liberties group and major Hispanic organizations still object to many other features of the bill.
On another hotly debated issue, the Judiciary Committee, by a vote of 15 to 12, eliminated sections of the bill that would place a ceiling on legal immigration and revamp the system for allocating visas.
The Justice Department, meanwhile, intensified its lobbying in support of the bill. Department officials told members of Congress today that passage of such a bill was the top legislative priority of Attorney General William French Smith.

Reagan Plans Appeal
Administration officials said that President Reagan would make a public appeal for passage of the immigration bill when he speaks on Friday, which is Citizenship Day, at a naturalization ceremony in Whitehouse Station, N.J., north of Trenton. Mr. Reagan is going to New Jersey to assist the Senate campaign of Representative Millicent Fenwick, a Republican.
With only three weeks remaining before adjournment, members of Congress said there was no way to determine whether the immigration bill would be enacted. The bill seemed to be gaining momentum today as the House Judiciary Committee considered numerous amendments, dealing with both major issues and minor details.
The forecast most often given by senior members of Congress was that the bill would gain approval from the Judiciary Committee, but would not reach the floor of the House. The new Congress, according to this forecast, could then resume work on an immigration bill next January.

Immigration1.0-35106,I.D. PLAN OPPOSED BY ADMINISTRATION,1982,8,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section a,929.0,"A Federal official said today that the Reagan Administration was vehemently opposed to a section of the Senate-approved immigration bill that requires the President to devise a system for verifying the identity of all job applicants, including United States citizens.
The system would be aimed at permitting employers to distinguish illegal aliens from citizens and aliens authorized to work in this country. Under the bill, an employer who knowingly hired illegal aliens would be subject to a civil fine of up to $2,000 for each illegal alien. If there was a ''pattern or practice'' of violations, the employer could also be imprisoned for six months.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 25 - A Federal official said today that the Reagan Administration was vehemently opposed to a section of the Senate-approved immigration bill that requires the President to devise a system for verifying the identity of all job applicants, including United States citizens.
Annelise G. Anderson, associate director of the Office of Management and Budget, said that the Administration opposed the Senate bill's provision for an identification system. The bill says that within three years the President must ''establish a secure system to determine employment eligibility in the United States.''
''The legislation says the system can be used only for worker identification purposes,'' Mrs. Anderson said in an interview. ''But the temptations to use it for other purposes in emergencies are extraordinary.''

Uses by Police Are Feared
Despite the safeguards, she said, officials may be tempted to use the system to enforce draft registration laws, to combat drug trafficking, to quell a riot or to investigate airport bombings.
Mrs. Anderson said the establishment of an employment eligibility system and its misuse were ''typical of totalitarian societies.'' ''One of the things that a totalitarian society can't abide is not being able to control the movement of people,'' she said. ''If you want to maintain a free society, you have to tolerate a little bit of slack in your ability to fully enforce the law. If you have everybody identified, you can stop people on the street to see if they have registered for the draft. If you have no I.D., you have no way to find these people.''
Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming and the chief sponsor of the Senate bill, tried to take account of such arguments in his bill. He inserted provisions ''to minimize the risk of undue invasion of privacy and the risk of Government abuse.''
''There is no 'slippery slope' toward loss of liberties,'' Mr.  Simpson said in the Senate, ''only a long staircase where each step downward must be first tolerated by the American people and their leaders.''

House Has Similar Bill
The Senate passed the Simpson bill last week by a vote of 81 to 18. The House Judiciary Committee plans to take up a similar bill on Sept. 14. Supporters of the House bill hope to complete floor action before Oct. 8, the target date for adjournment. The House is not scheduled to convene again before Election Day, Nov. 2, but there has been talk of a lame-duck session after the Congressional elections.
The Senate and House bills both provide that for three years employers could rely on the best existing documents to check the eligibility of job applicants. The documents include passports, Social Security cards, birth certificates and drivers' licenses.
The ''secure system'' would be introduced after three years. The Senate bill says the system must be designed so it ''will reliably determine that a person with the identity claimed by an employee or prospective employee is eligible to work, and that the employee or prospective employee is not claiming the identity of another individual.''
It also says, ''If the system requires an examination by an employer of any document, such document must be in a form which is resistant to counterfeiting and tampering.''

Called Too Expensive
Mrs. Anderson said it would be ''extraordinarily expensive'' to devise a system to meet the rigorous requirements of the Senate bill, which authorizes $10 million to begin developing it.
Mrs. Anderson said the total cost, spread over several years, might exceed $1.5 billion. The basis for that figure, she said, is that there are more than 100 million people in the civilian labor force and the cost of producing each secure document, such as a passport, is about $15.
Senator Simpson acknowledged that the costs could be substantial, but he said there were also ''tremendous costs'' to society from inadequate enforcement of the immigration laws.
Attorney General William French Smith said it was ''inappropriate'' for Congress to presume that particular changes would have to be made in the existing documents. Some changes may be necessary, he said, but ''that remains to be assessed.''

Cards Common in Europe
Identity cards have long been common in parts of Europe. France, West Germany, Belgium and Italy have such cards. In this country, Federal agencies and advisory committees have repeatedly studied the idea of a national identification system, and they have generally discouraged the idea.
The Social Security Administration said this month that in an effort to frustrate counterfeiters, it would start issuing Social Security cards on bank-note paper next year. Senate aides said they doubted that such cards could satisfy the Simpson bill's requirements for a secure system.
The Senate bill does not specify whether the President should use identification cards, a computerized data bank or some other device.

Immigration1.0-35124,ILLEGAL ALIENS,1982,8,new york times,By Alan K. Simpson,section a,906.0,"All objective, comprehensive studies of the problem of illegal immigration, including those by the Ford, Carter and Reagan Administrations, and by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, have concluded that adequate enforcement of immigration laws cannot be achieved without greatly reducing the incentive represented by the temptation of employment in the United States.
For this reason, section 101 of the proposed Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1982 is the single provision most urgently needed to assist in reducing illegal immigration. This section would make unlawful the knowing hiring of illegal aliens and would provide a system that enables employers to verify that job applicants are American citizens or legal aliens. Section 101 and the bill's other provisions are strongly supported by the Administration, by an imposing array of newspapers and special-interest groups and by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
WASHINGTON - All objective, comprehensive studies of the problem of illegal immigration, including those by the Ford, Carter and Reagan Administrations, and by the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy, have concluded that adequate enforcement of immigration laws cannot be achieved without greatly reducing the incentive represented by the temptation of employment in the United States.
Yet, the United States Chamber of Commerce has spiritedly lobbied against this provision. The most startling feature of its opposition is that it appears to be based solely on a selfish perception of employers' short-term, purely economic interest: profitability. That is not the right perspective.
To properly assess the economic impact of illegal immigration, we must consider long-term effects. Moreover, even a totally selfish person does not act solely to achieve economic goals; adverse noneconomic impacts can often make an economic benefit unpalatable.  Thus, consideration of the effects of illegal immigration on our population, of potential social and political changes and of historical immigration objectives must be part of the decision-making process.
The Chamber argues that any secure verification system would be ''too expensive.'' As evidence, it has published some extraordinarily high cost estimates. More objective sources present less-alarming figures: $100 million to $300 million per year. Certainly, these are not small numbers, but inadequate enforcement also involves major costs. The number of illegal aliens in this country in 1978 has been estimated at 3.5 million to six million. Even if those estimates are used and it is assumed that only 2 percent hold jobs that unemployed Americans would take, then the cost in public assistance and unemployment benefits to the jobless is $490 million to $840 million. The actual number of people displaced from jobs is probably substantially higher. The number of illegal aliens is estimated to have increased by 500,000 per year. This calculation does not even consider the other, less easily quantifiable costs of illegal immigration.
The Chamber states that the verification procedure would be ''too burdensome'' for employers. Actually, the procedure would be optional for those with three or fewer employees. Larger employers would be required simply to examine in good faith a United States passport or two other documents - say, a driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card - complete and sign a short form and have that form signed by the employee. The employer would not be responsible for the authenticity of the documents, only for their reasonably appearing genuine. Without this system, the two key goals of section 101 could not both be achieved: screening illegal aliens out of the workforce and avoiding discrimination against citizens and legal aliens who look or sound ''foreign'' to employers.
The most disappointing part of the Chamber's argument is the assertion that individuals, including businessmen, have no obligation to assist the Government in enforcing our laws. That view is certainly not consistent with our tradition of responsible citizenship and limited government.
Does the Chamber feel that businesses' legal obligation to withhold income and Social Security taxes is also unreasonable?  There no practical alternative. Moreover, a legitimate businessman ought not knowingly hire illegal aliens and thereby provide the major incentive for violating one of the most fundamental laws of a sovereign nation - the one controlling its borders.
Fortunately, most businessmen do not share the Chamber's view.  Other business groups support the bill - the National Association of Manufacturers, for example. Many local Chambers of Commerce, including those in Texas and California, where there are great numbers of illegal immigrants, have acknowledged the need for such reform.
The sponsors are attempting to protect America from uncontrolled immigration for the sake of their children and grandchildren, while keeping at bay the specter of meanness, nativism and racism.  Fortunately, a sizeable majority of Americans are willing hark to an appeal to rise above any special interest they may have in order to obtain workable immigration reform. It is puzzling why the United States Chamber of Commerce is not.

Immigration1.0-35757,ILLEGAL ALIENS: IMPACT IN CITY IS UNCERTAIN,1984,9,new york times,By ELAINE SCIOLINO,section b,2009.0,"Most of the illegal aliens in New York City have jobs and earn as much as legal aliens, and most pay Social Security taxes and some income taxes, according to many immigration specialists.
Researchers also believe that the presence of a vast illegal population in New York tends to keep wages low and working conditions poor and that many illegal aliens have successfully and fraudulently enrolled in public-assistance programs.
As a result, the role of illegal aliens in the city's economy is a mixture of often-conflicting benefits and drains that has defied systematic analysis by economists and immigration experts.
Most government agencies, sensitive to charges of discrimination, are reluctant to single out particular ethnic and racial groups and, therefore, data based on national origins or even places of birth is not readily available.

'A Child Is a Child'
The Board of Education, probably the agency most used by illegal aliens, asks for birth certificates only as proof of a child's age. The board gets state aid for illegal aliens, as it does for all students.
Article examines uncertainity over impact illegal aliens have on New York City and its economy; many immigration experts say that most of illegal aliens in city have jobs and earn as much as legal aliens and most pay Social Security taxes and some income taxes; researchers also believe that presence of vast illegal population in city tends to keep wages down and working conditions poor and that many illegal aliens have successfully and fraudulently enrolled in public assistance programs; illustration (L)
''A child is a child, and we don't investigate whether he is here illegally or not,'' a board spokesman, Gloria Lesser, said. ''It's not an issue.''
A four-year-old suit by the city and state against the Census Bureau contends that minority groups, including illegal aliens, were undercounted in the 1980 Census, depriving the city and state of a rightful share of Congressional representation and Federal revenue sharing. A decision is expected in Federal court by the end of the year.
There is no agreement on the number of illegal aliens in the city. There are 200,000 according to one analysis of the 1980 Census, 500,000 according to many academicians and the New York district office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and 750,000 according to the City Planning Commission.
The Census Bureau has said that if there was undercounting, at least $9.40 in revenue sharing would be lost for each person not counted. The city and state argue that the estimate should be more than doubled.

Loss of $2.8 Million a Year
Even if the immigration service estimate is correct and the city's is too high, an undercounting of 300,000 would mean that New York is losing a minimum of $2.8 million a year in revenue sharing.
To help identify trends among all foreign- born people in New York - legal as well as illegal - the Planning Commission began a study a year ago that it expects to complete next year.
A Planning Commission memo last March on the status of the study highlights the difficulties of the task.
''City agencies do not seem to have standardized policies about reporting illegals to the I.N.S., and there is no consistency in how these issues are handled,'' it said. ''Similarly, the I.N.S. has no hard and fast policy on the types of cases it will prosecute and those it will ignore.''
Last July, Mayor Koch created an Office of Immigrant Affairs at the Planning Commission to complete the study and coordinate services for immigrants. The head of the office, Elizabeth Bogen, said: ''There's been a laissez-faire attitude to studying illegal aliens, because people in the power structure tend to believe they don't cause much of a problem and because the issue is such a political hot potato that discussing it would cause more harm than good. That's why we've decided to study the impact of all aliens, without getting hung up on the issue of illegals per se.''
Despite the absence of a comprehensive survey, several conclusions about the cost-benefit ratio of illegal aliens can be made, according to immigration specialists.

Comparison With Other Workers
A recent Gallup poll found that most Americans believed illegal aliens ended up on welfare and raised tax burdens. That view is disputed by almost all immigration specialists, who say most illegal aliens have jobs.
A study by New York University in 1981 on immigrants from the Dominican Republic in three city neighborhoods found that almost all legal and illegal immigrants worked and that they found jobs within a week after they started to look for them.
The study also found that there was almost no difference in job experience or income levels of aliens based on legal status and that most aliens earned at least the minimum wage.
''Illegals are generally working people, and the notion that they cost society a great deal is a myth,'' said Glauco Perez, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and executive assistant for policy and program development at the New York City Human Resources Adminstration.

Wages in Restaurants
Other academics say that well over half the illegal population pays Social Security and Federal, state and local income taxes. They say that although illegal aliens are helping to pay for Social Security, most will never receive the benefits.
A study this year by Thomas Bailey, a research associate at Columbia University, based on interviews with 90 New York restaurant owners and managers, found legality made little difference in what immigrant restaurant workers were paid, although they were ''willing to take restaurant work at wages well below those that would be acceptable to large numbers of native- born adult male blacks.''
Some economists say that low wages keep labor costs and retail prices down, which in turn allow industries facing severe competition to survive. They say that without low-wage immigrant labor, the garment industry, for example, would have to move many of its operations overseas to remain competitive, and dozens of ethnic restaurants would have to go out of business.
Because illegal aliens are willing to work hard and not complain, the economists said, they tend to be a favored work force in a number of industries.

'Willingness to Work'
In a study of Southern California in the 1970's, Thomas Muller, an economist with the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research organization in Washington that studies social and political issues, found that employers preferred undocumented workers for their ''willingness to work under poorer conditions to those acceptable to most Americans, low absenteeism and solid work habits.''
It is generally accepted that illegal aliens have to work more for less, especially if their employers are aware of their illegal status.
''I have a good boss, I work hard, I don't complain and I don't have any problems,'' said a 23-year-old Salvadoran man who packs vegetables for the minimum wage, $3.35 an hour, in Brooklyn.
Many illegal aliens function just like citizens - not only working and paying taxes, but also getting promotions.
One 26-year-old woman from India, who arrived here in 1979 and paid an American man $3,000 to marry her, has been living in the United States illegally ever since the Immigration Service discovered her fraudulent marriage.
She has used a valid Social Security card - issued to her only for the purpose of opening a bank account - to get a variety of jobs, including a clerk in a jewelry store, a laundry worker, a dishwasher in a bakery and a counter person at McDonald's and Burger King. Some of her employers paid her as little as $2 an hour. Many aliens misuse their cards in this way.

'Grateful for America'
She now does word processing at a New York brokerage concern for $16,000 a year.
''Every year I file my tax return, just like everyone else,'' she said. ''I'm grateful for America, for giving me the chance to stand on my own two feet.''
She used her own name, Social Security number and her file number for an application for permanent residence status that she received when she and her husband were first interviewed by the Immigration Service. Neither the Immigration Service nor the I.R.S. has made cases like hers a top priority. No effort is now being made to deport her.
Illegal aliens cannot avoid sales taxes or indirect property taxes, such as those figured in rental charges. But many are paid their salaries in cash ''off the books'' and never pay income tax.  ''Living in New York takes big money,'' said a 32-year-old South Korean graduate student, who cannot legally work on his student visa. He supplements money he receives from his family by working at an Oriental publication for $4 an hour in cash.
''I feel guilty working and not paying taxes, but morally I have the right to exist and work while I'm studying in New York,'' he said.
Illegal aliens are ineligible for public assistance programs, and only sketchy estimates of their fraudulent use exist.

Effect on Assistance
In a study based on interviews with nearly 800 apprehended illegal aliens, David S. North, a political scientist with the New TransCentury Foundation in Washington, said that illegal aliens made substantial but below- average use of tax-supported programs and that legal immigrants made average use of them.
It is somewhat easier for illegal aliens to receive unemployment benefits than public assistance. Most workers whose employers pay them legally are covered by unemployment insurance, and many aliens belong to unions that help them in applying for unemployment.
Illegal aliens have the greatest impact on the health-care and education systems. They try to avoid going to private doctors because of the expense and tend to rely on public hospitals, particularly emergency and delivery rooms, for care. The City Health and Hospitals Corporation estimates that unreimbursed inpatient care of illegal aliens in New York costs $28 million a year.
''I try never to get sick,'' said the young woman from India. ''When I need medical care, I ask a friend who's married to a doctor to get a prescription for me.''

Competition for Resources
Voluntary agencies said there was little they could do to help aliens. ''Once in a while, we can help with a doctor or even an operation, but there's nothing we can do if the alien needs $400 a day inpatient hospital care,'' said the Rev. Peter Zendzian of the Catholic Migration and Refugee Office of the Diocese of Brooklyn.
A 1979 study by the Federal Labor Department that is often cited by the Immigration Service estimated that one in five jobs held by illegal aliens - among a total of 1.2 million jobs - could be filled by unemployed Americans.
''Illegal aliens detract from the city because they are competing for jobs and benefits and putting a drain on social services,'' said Lawrence Paretta, assistant director for investigations of the Immigration Service's New York office. ''I've never bought the argument that that no one else will do the work - if the wages and conditions are good.''
In the last 10 months, through various investigations, the district office said, it has saved more than $5 million in fraudulent unemployment, student loan, Medicaid and public-housing payments.
To prevent social-service payments to illegal aliens, the Immigration Service last year began Project SAVE - which stands for Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement - in Colorado, Illinois and California.
It is a cooperative, computerized effort between the Immigration Service, other Federal organizations and state agencies. So far, the three states have sought to uncover only unemployment fraud, by carefully checking all aliens applying for aid to make sure they are eligible.
New York will be among the next five states to join the program.
When all 50 states are in the program, the Immigration Service predicts a combined saving of $10.7 billion at the end of two years, an estimate that most immigration researchers feel is too high.
Researchers also believe that as long as the economy is expanding and illegal aliens can get jobs, undocumented workers will continue to pour into New York.
''This is our country's version of Europe's guest-worker policy,'' Mr. Muller said. ''Not only the supply is here, but the demand, too.''

Immigration1.0-35308,ILLEGAL IMMINGRANTS PAYING THEIR DUES,1983,12,new york times,,section a,284.0,"To the Editor:
The Dec. 3 letter by Roger Conner of the Federation for American Immigration Reform is dead wrong.
Curtailing illegal immigration will not ''keep future budget deficits from growing.''
Rather, it will augment budget deficits and accelerate the depletion of the Social Security Trust Fund since these workers contribute so much to the gross national product and take so little out of the economy.
According to a 1979 Labor Department study, undocumented workers spend 60 percent of their wages in the U.S., and 75 percent of them pay Social Security and income taxes, even though only 0.5 percent receive welfare and one percent receive food stamps. Ten percent - and every day more - join America's labor unions, helping to keep them alive.
If Mr. Conner's assumption that 21 percent take jobs from Americans were true, then why did the Government's ''Operation Jobs'' fail to deliver more than a handful of jobs to American applicants for vacancies created by the arrest of 5,635 workers in May 1982 (87 percent of whom were Mexican and most of whom were back at work within days)?
Eliminating illegal immigration will not achieve ''the protection of American workers.'' In fact, implementation of legislation such as the Simpson-Mazzoli bill will mean admitting more Mexican workers than ever before - but under regulated conditions that will help preserve slumping American businesses and stimulate the growth of new ones with low-wage, non-organized labor to the detriment of
all

workers, especially the Spanish-speaking and dark- skinned.

Immigration1.0-35334,IMMIGRATION AND POLITICS,1983,10,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section a,1003.0,"Supporters of a comprehensive immigration bill have boasted that they were taking a bipartisan or nonpartisan approach. But Tuesday's indefinite postponement of Congressional action on the bill illustrates the perils of underestimating the political importance of a powerful lobby.
The Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., announced that the bill would not go to the floor for a vote this year because of strong opposition from Hispanic Americans. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus today took credit for killing the bill, which they fear would increase job discrimination against members of ethnic and racial minority groups. Under the bill, employers who knowingly hired illegal aliens would be subject to civil and criminal penalties.
Robert Pear analysis of why Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform bill has failed to come to vote in Congress this session; says ultimate reason is that its opponents cared more deeply about its impact than its proponents did (M)
Commenting on the Speaker's action, Representative Robert Garcia, Democrat of the Bronx, said, ''This was a major victory for the Hispanic Caucus.'' Representative Edward R. Roybal, Democrat of California, praised Mr. O'Neill as ''a profile in courage.''
The bill provides a classic example of how a well-organized, highly motivated lobby may, in terms of political calculations, outweigh a generalized public concern. But, as Mr. Roybal said, ''The opposition to this bill was not limited to Hispanics.'' Ultimately, it appears, the bill failed because the opponents, including Texans and Californians, cared more deeply about its impact than did the proponents.
If there was a constituency for the bill, it was shallow. Civil rights groups, state and local governments, labor unions and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States objected to key provisions of the Senate-passed bill supported by the Reagan Administration. They never gave the House bill more than lukewarm support.
Politics, by one definition, is the ability to reconcile diverse conflicting interests. But on the question of illegal aliens, there was no such reconciliation. Larry Speakes, the chief White House spokesman, said: ''This is not a political issue. It is not a partisan issue.''
The campaign for an immigration bill was led by a Republican, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, and a Democrat, Representative Romano L. Mazzoli of Kentucky. Senator Simpson said that partisanship never ''entered the fray'' until Mr. O'Neill spoke out and, as Mr. Simpson put it, pulled the bill down to the level of petty politics.

Price of Ignoring Politics
The lofty, nonpolitical approach appears, in retrospect, to have been naive, or at least too idealistic. In Congress, lawmakers and lobbyists ignore politics at their peril.
Dale Frederick Swartz, president of the National Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Forum, a private nonprofit group, said:
''Mr. O'Neill was right in saying there is not a strong constituency for the approach taken in the Simpson- Mazzoli bill. The sponsors tried to do too much in one bill, so the politics became extremely complicated, and no major interests were sufficiently satisfied to give the bill strong or unequivocal support.''
Several officials expressed outrage at the result, saying the will of the majority had been frustrated by a minority. Attorney General William French Smith said ''the overwhelming majority of Americans will be dismayed'' by the Speaker's action. Public opinion polls show that most Americans, including most Hispanic Americans, ''favor immigration reform,'' Mr. Smith said.

Bitterness on Speaker's Action
Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, said ''the notion that majority rule has anything to do with the legislative process is absolutely wrong'' because ''if the Speaker doesn't want the bill to be debated or voted on, it's dead.''
Representative Daniel E. Lungren, a California Republican, asked the Speaker, ''How great does the problem have to get before you are going to allow us to act?'' Border Patrol officers apprehended more than one million illegal aliens on the Southern border in the year that ended Sept. 30.
Hispanic members of Congress said they would seek alternatives to the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, emphasizing the international context of the problem. Representative Bill Richardson, a New Mexico Democrat whose mother is Mexican, said, ''We cannot be viewed just as obstructionists.'' Representative Esteban Edward Torres, a California Democrat, said: ''Illegal immigration is not just a domestic problem. It transcends our borders. It is a foreign policy question.''
No one can say for sure whether illegal immigration will be a major issue in the 1984 elections. President Reagan and other Republicans could chide Mr. O'Neill for blocking action to address a serious problem, but such criticism could backfire. Hispanic members of Congress and leaders of Hispanic organizations said the Democrats would benefit from frequent reminders about Mr. O'Neill's role.

Data on Hispanic Americans
The Census Bureau said that in 1980, there were 14.6 million Hispanic Americans, including 8.2 million of voting age. The bureau estimated that 3 million Hispanic Americans were registered and 2.5 million voted in 1980.
The challenge for the Democrats now is to articulate the principles they would follow as an alternative to the Simpson-Mazzoli bill. But it is far easier to talk about general principles, such as nondiscrimination, than to offer specific proposals. The Hispanic groups have apparently ruled out ''employer sanctions,'' the system of penalties designed to curtail the hiring of illegal aliens. That system is at the heart of the major proposals made in the Ford, Carter and Reagan Administrations.
For President Reagan and other Federal officials, the challenge now is to prevent a backlash against immigration and immigrants. Representative Garcia appealed to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, saying, ''Don't take any revenge against Hispanics by conducting sweeps into places of employment or places where our people are living.''

Immigration1.0-35764,IMMIGRATION BILL BEFORE CONFEREES,1984,9,new york times,By ROBERT PEAR,section b,745.0,"Seven Senators and 29 Representatives plan to meet Thursday in an effort to begin drafting a comprehensive immigration bill passed in different forms by the two houses of Congress.
The first meeting of the conference committee comes 12 weeks after the House passed the bill, 216 to 211. The Senate approved its version of the legislation by a vote of 76 to 18 in May 1983.
The Senate and House versions would both prohibit employment of illegal aliens and offer legal status to many illegal aliens already in the country. They differ on the penalties for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens and on the terms of the amnesty, which are more restrictive in the Senate bill.
The Reagan Administration strongly supports the Senate bill, but has described some of the House amendments as unacceptable. Administration officials contend that the House version would be too costly because the Federal Government might have to reimburse states for the costs of providing welfare and social services to aliens who gained legal status.
Hispanic leaders, who believe that the employer sanctions would increase discrimination against Hispanic workers, stepped up lobbying against the bill this week. They met Tuesday with the House majority leader, Representative Jim Wright, Democrat of Texas, who voted for the bill when it passed on June 20.

'The Prospects Are Bleak'
Mr. Wright said today, ''The prospects are bleak for passage of any immigration legislation this year.''
Hispanic said Congress could conceivably finish work on the bill before adjournment.
Following is a summary of major issues facing the conference:

Employer Sanctions: The Senate and House bills would both require employers to ask all job applicants for documents to verify that they were citizens or aliens authorized to work in the United States. Both bills contain an exemption for employers with three or fewer employees.
Under the Senate bill, after a one- year transition period, the Government could assess a civil penalty of $1,000 against an employer for each illegal alien hired. If there was a second offense, the employer would be subject to a $2,000 penalty for each illegal alien, and for a ''pattern or practice'' of violations, the employer could be fined $1,000 and imprisoned six months.
The House bill has no criminal penalties. After a six-month transition period, an employer would receive a citation or warning for the first offense. For a second offense, the employer would be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 for each illegal alien hired. In any subsequent offense, the employer would be subject to a civil penalty of $2,000 for each illegal alien hired.

Amnesty: The House bill offers legal status to illegal aliens who entered the United States before Jan. 1, 1982, and have lived here continuously since that date. The comparable date in the Senate bill is Jan. 1, 1980.
The House bill provides that illegal aliens would first have to become ''lawful temporary residents.'' After one year, the aliens could seek permanent resident status if they were studying the English language and the history and government of the United States.
The Senate bill offers immediate permanent resident status to illegal aliens who arrived before Jan. 1, 1977. It offers temporary status to those who arrived from Jan. 1, 1977, to Dec. 31, 1979, and after three years in that status, they could become permanent residents.

Legalization Costs: The House bill says that the Federal Government ''shall provide reimbursement to each state'' for 100 percent of the costs of cash and medical assistance to aliens who gain legal status. Congress could later limit outlays if it wished. The Senate bill would establish a Federal grant for assistance to the states, but does not specify the amount.

Foreign Workers: Both bills would make it easier for employers to bring aliens into the country as temporary foreign workers, tied to a specific place of employment. The House bill would, in addition, create a special program for farmers who need help harvesting perishable fruit and vegetables.

Discrimination: The House bill would prohibit employers from discriminating against legal aliens in hiring or recruiting workers.
The Senate bill has no comparable provisions, but would require the General Accounting Office to determine whether employer sanctions led to a ''pattern of discrimination.''

Immigration1.0-35123,IMMIGRATION BILL HAS PERSONAL ROOTS,1982,8,new york times,"By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to the New York Times",section a,958.0,"Back in World War II, when he was a teen-ager in Cody, Wyo., Alan K. Simpson would visit a Japanese-American internment camp and play with children his age who were living behind barbed wire.
''There I was, 13 years old, and the third largest city in Wyoming sprang up on the sagebrush between Cody and Powell,'' he recalled.  ''I would go to the scout meetings. Here were boys with the same scout uniforms, the same merit badges, the same comic books, the same raunchy stories that all 13-year-old boys tell, and they were behind barbed wire. I would talk with their parents and grandparents, who were living in tarpaper shacks.''
WASHINGTON - Back in World War II, when he was a teen-ager in Cody, Wyo., Alan K. Simpson would visit a Japanese-American internment camp and play with children his age who were living behind barbed wire.
Today Mr. Simpson, now 50 years old, is a Republican Senator from Wyoming. He is the co-author of a bill that has drawn mixed reactions from both conservatives and liberals because it proposes the first major revision in 30 years in Federal laws governing aliens and immigration. (The bill is to be considered by the Senate within days.)
Mr. Simpson says that his legislative approach was significantly affected by his experience with the Japanese-Americans who, for no reason other than their ancestry, were summarily interned during the fear-filled days immediately after Pearl Harbor.

National Identification Card
The immigration proposal would give legal status to aliens who arrived in this country before 1982, would provide for a national identification card for them and would penalize employers who hired illegal aliens.
The co-author of the bill with Mr. Simpson is Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, a 49-year-old Kentucky Democrat. He says he became involved in immigration law as a result of his exposure to the Rev.  Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame University who was chairman of the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy that was established a few years ago by Congress. A number of the commission's conclusions are incorporated in the Simpson-Mazzoli bill.
For Senator Simpson, whose easygoing humor has made him one of the best-liked men in the Senate, the teen-age experience gave him a lifelong distaste for internment situations. ''You'd go downtown and you'd see a Japanese-American trustee for the camp who had two sons fighting with the 91st division in Italy, and next door there would be a sign, 'No Japs Allowed,' '' the Senator recalled.
Mr. Simpson, whose lanky frame towers above that of Mr. Mazzoli and almost everyone else in Congress, is the tall part of what Mr.  Mazzoli calls ''The Mutt and Jeff Sideshow.''
''We've taken it to the Borscht Belt of Immigration,'' Mr. Mazzoli says, referring to San Diego, San Antonio, El Paso, Houston, New York, Florida and other immigration and refugee centers.
''People are surprised that a Republican from Wyoming and a Democrat from Kentucky can be completely compatible,'' Mr. Simpson said. ''There's not a shred of partisanship.''
For those surprised that a Wyoming Senator became involved in immigration law, even considering his World War II experience, Mr.  Simpson notes that his state has four times as many Hispanics as American Indians and points out that Wyoming's Park County ''was one of the largest users and abusers of the Bracero program in the United States.'' He recalls how Mexicans brought here to pick sugar beets, were ''skewered by the car dealers'' and other merchants.

Labor Day Assurance
The Senate leadership has promised Mr. Simpson, who has made special visits to Cuban and Hatian refugee camps, that his immigration measure will be on the floor before Labor Day. However, Mr. Mazzoli has received no such assurances from the House leadership.
The Simpson-Mazzoli bill has evoked considerable controversy because of its provisions for sanctions against employers who hire illegal aliens and its provision for a national identity card so that prospective employees might ''prove'' that they are citizens or permanent residents. ''We want to end the magnet that draws people to this country,'' Mr. Mazzoli said.
The measure also is controversial because it would grant permanent resident status to aliens who entered this country by Jan. 1, l982, and would provide a temporary employment program for aliens who come to work in specific jobs. Further, it would permit summary exclusion of an alien entering the United States without the necessary documents, unless the person asserted some ''reasonable basis''for being admitted or claimed asylum.

Annual Immigration Limited
Finally, the measure calls for a limit of 425,000 immigrants a year, the current level. No nation could send more than 20,000 immigrants, with the exception of Mexico and Canada, which could send 40,000 each.
The proposed hiring sanctions in the bill have been vigorously opposed by an unusual alliance that includes the United States Chamber of Commerce, the American Civil Liberties Union and various Hispanic groups. On the other hand, some other Hispanic groups, a number of editorial writers and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. have strongly praised the bill.
Some Hispanic groups fear that the sanctions on employers will undermine the job-hunting efforts of Hispanic Americans because employers will not want to risk hiring illegal aliens. Some civil rights groups fear the precedent of a national identity card as a first step toward a police state. Other groups consider the bill to be racist.
''The toughest part of our job is the education process,'' Mr.  Simpson said. ''This is an issue that just can cut you to ribbons.''

Immigration1.0-35424,ITALIAN-AMERICANS COMING INTO THEIR OWN,1983,5,new york times,"By Stephen S. Hall; Stephen S. Hall, a freelance writer based in New York, is the grandson of Italian immigrants.",section 6,7764.0,"HERE ARE A NUMBER OF ways to assess the quiet yet spectacular rise of Italian-Americans in the United States today, but one of the best perspectives is from the 57th-floor windows of the Governor's New York City office in the World Trade Center. The view takes in Ellis Island, twin symbol of opportunity and pain to countless immigrants, and, beyond, the flat and colorless industrial precincts of Jersey City.
It was there that young Andrea Cuomo, a recent arrival in 1926 from the south of Italy, toiled as the classic pick-and-shovel immigrant.  He dug ditches and cleaned sewers and became, in the words of social historians who came later, part of the human ''dung'' that fertilized America's industrial growth.
Andrea Cuomo's son - whose birth was attended by midwives, who spoke only Italian until the age of 8, who was counseled by ''wellintentioned'' law-school officials to change his vowel-laden last name if he wanted to get ahead in life - now occupies the Governor's chair. From this eyrie of power, with its clear vista upon emblems of his personal past, it is tempting to suggest that Mario M. Cuomo has traveled a great distance in one generation.
Highlights of the Italian-American community, which represents 7% of the population
''Very little distance,'' he says, quietly disagreeing. ''Very little distance. If my father had had my education, it would have been no distance. In terms of economic condition, we've improved.  But as a family, as individuals, as people of merit and excellence, I don't think I've yet improved on my father.''
Italian-Americans have sometimes been regarded as being slow to assimilate and climb America's social and economic ladders, even by their own historians, but now - as they swell the ranks of the middle class, amass power and wealth, and help set the decade's social and political agendas as never before - it may be that they have simply measured success, as Mario Cuomo has done, by a different yardstick, and made their way to the mainstream by a slightly different route.  Barely a century ago, in 1880, the number of Italians in the United States totaled a mere 44,000. Now, Americans of Italian descent represent an estimated 7 percent of the population, and in recent years they have attained a kind of critical mass in terms of affluence, education, aspiration and self-acceptance - so much so that the political analyst Theodore H. White, in his 1982 book ''America in Search of Itself,'' identifies Italian-Americans as ''the most important among the rising ethnic groups.''
To be sure, the Italian-American community has never been slack in the production of distinguished individuals, but those of earlier generations flourished - like the Italians themselves -in highly circumscribed worlds. In stadiums, it was Joe DiMaggio; under the spotlights, it was Frank Sinatra; and in city government, it was Fiorello H. La Guardia, the consummate local politician of his era.  But today's Italian-Americans have stepped out, as it were, and become prominent players with national impact as well as a national following, taking the initiative in crucial political and social issues.
Lido (Lee) A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, has come to represent a no-nonsense integrity and can-do dash in the executive suite. Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, Archbishop of Chicago, has brought humanism and militance together in the movement of Roman Catholic bishops opposed to nuclear arms. Eleanor Cutri Smeal, who recently concluded five years as president of the National Organization for Women, is credited with giving feminism a grassroots appeal attractive to middle-class housewives. Perhaps more important, they represent merely the brightest lights in a general fluorescence of Italians in American life, a fluorescence confirmed almost on a daily basis.
If it isn't Jim Valvano coaching North Carolina State to the college basketball championship, for example, it is Joe Paterno coaching Penn State to a national title in college football, or Tommy Lasorda and Billy Martin managing World Series teams. If it isn't a new movie by Francis Ford Coppola or Martin Scorsese, it is a new interpretation of architecture by the architect Robert Venturi, the ''father of postmodernism.'' If it isn't a new Broadway musical by Michael Bennett (''Dreamgirls''), it is a new shopping mall built by Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., the Youngstown, Ohio, businessman and sports magnate who is probably the wealthiest Italian-American in the country - reportedly worth more than $500 million. And in the world of higher education, there are now such names as A. Bartlett Giamatti of Yale and John Lo Schiavo of the University of San Francisco.
Is there a single thread that runs through these people? If anything, it is the unusual propensity to merge, rather than separate, the professional and the personal. Borrowing from a culture in which the extended family can easily include 30 to 40 ''close'' relatives, Italians thrive on community. They are accustomed to large numbers of people, and they seem to have developed an emotional facility in dealing with them. Even in large companies, they have a knack for keeping things on a human scale. ''The professional community,'' explains one Italian-American psychotherapist, ''becomes the next family.''
Probably the most significant symbol of the Italian-American emergence is Governor Cuomo, who has practically made a political doctrine out of the concept of family. ''With us, it's going from small family to big family, the state of New York. Everything I do revolves around the notion of sharing benefits and burdens in the community.  And that's family.''
He remains comfortably aware of his ethnic background and easily interprets the historical moment through a familial lens. ''Most of the Italians who came through Ellis Island were like my mother and father,'' says the 50-year-old Governor, whose parents abandoned two mountain villages in the Campania region south of Naples. ''No education. No skills. They called them cafoni (rubes). They were the lowest strata, economically and socially.
''We are their sons and daughters, educated for the first time,'' he continues. ''What's happening now is that the generation of turnof-the-century Mediterranean immigrants is just now gathering to itself the kind of strength, affluence and comfort that allows it to reach out for power.''
That process, in fact, has been perceptible for more than a decade. Italian-Americans no longer resemble the stereotypical image of opera-loving blue-collar ethnics airing laundry, and personal grievances, from the windows of Italian ghettos. Instead, they are upwardly mobile - doggedly so. According to Alfred J. Tella, special adviser to the director of the Census Bureau, their presence in white-collar positions now appears to mirror national averages, they have moved to the suburbs, and they have no more children than the average American family. As breadwinners, they have made steady but striking progress: In 1979, Americans of purely Italian ancestry had a median family income of $16,993, out-earning all other ethnic groups except the Scots and the Germans (both of whom arrived well ahead of the Italians).
''It's the story of a three-generation success,'' says Mr. Tella, who estimates the number of Italian-Americans at approximately 15 million. ''Around the turn of the century, menial labor was synonymous with Italians. But they sacrificed a lot to get an education for their children, and they all wanted to own their own houses. Those were the twin drives. Now Italians have fully caught up with non-Italians in the upper echelons of professional and managerial occupations.'' MONG WHITE ETHNIC groups, there is probably no other culture that has so conscientiously and successfully husbanded its traditional values - from the close-knit family structure to the exuberant celebration of feasts -into the present moment. To be sure, some traditions, such as the use of the Italian language, have eroded, prompting some observers to regard ethnic identity in the later generations as mainly cosmetic. But surveys over the last two decades by the National Opinion Research Center in Chicago, for example, consistently show that Italian-Americans retain closer family ties than virtually every other ethnic or religious group. It has been a happy accident, in fact, that the Italians, by stubbornly refusing to abandon their old customs, have hung on long enough to see those values take on enhanced value as they move more boldly into the mainstream. ''A sense of respect and loyalty, a respect for family members, the cohesiveness of the family - I think of these values as fundamental to our interactions with other people,'' says Aileen Riotto Sirey, a psychotherapist and president of the National Organization of Italian-American Women.  Those attitudes reflect a particularly Italian way of looking at things. ''Italian-Americans are not generally rigid in terms of their professions being all-consuming - you'll seldom find a single-faceted Italian-American who devotes 20 hours a day to one narrow activity,'' notes former United States Attorney General Benjamin R.  Civiletti, 47, whose ancestors came from Palermo and Genoa. ''That gives them not only a diversity of views, and a healthiness of mental outlook, but also the ability to endure problems and cope.''
And cope they did, during a long and painful journey to social acceptance in this country. Given the cachet that all things Italian enjoy today - from food to fashion to a certain vivaciousness of life style - it is difficult to conceive of just how great a liability it once was to be Italian in this country.
More than five million Italians have emigrated to the United States since 1820. Like other nationalities that preceded and followed them, the Italians encountered hatred and discrimination, but discrimination was a feature of their native land, too.
THE GREAT MASS OF ITALIANS arrived around the turn of the century (some four million Italians came here between 1880 and 1920), and about three-fourths of the total came from the Mezzogiorno, the beautifully stark and historically underdeveloped regions east and south of Rome that even today have as much in common with the third world as with Western Europe.
The southern Italians, who were contemptuosly dismissed as ''Africans'' by northerners in their own country, had endured centuries of oppression in their native provinces. From the ancient Greeks to the revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi to the Germans during World War II, southern Italy has been overrun by outsiders, and few were as benevolent as Garibaldi. In a place where political foundations shifted frequently and unpredictably, loyalty to any institution beyond the family was dangerous and unwise - fostering an attitude of suspicion that became ingrained over the centuries.
Although a handful of the immigrants were professionals, the majority, according to the sociologist William V. D'Antonio, were unskilled, unschooled and illiterate even in their own language. In many cases, they had never traveled beyond the limits of their rural villages before trying to resettle in America's most bustling metropolises - New York, Boston, Philadelphia and virtually every other major city in the industrial East. (Relatively fewer numbers settled in the Middle West or on the West Coast.) Some of the immigrants who came to America were dark-skinned and, to many American minds, sinister looking. And many had no intention of staying.
Fully half of the Italians who emigrated to this country ultimately returned to Italy, a rarely noted fact that reveals a fundamental ambivalence about being in the United States in the first place.  Mostly male and single, the first wave of immigrants, known as ''sojourners'' or ''economic opportunists,'' came to America simply to make money; they would then return to Italy, buy land, and settle down.
In this respect, the Italian experience was markedly different from that of the Irish (the major immigrant group preceding them) and the Eastern European Jews (a group that arrived simultaneously). The Irish became central in Democratic politics and cultivated the Roman Catholic Church (including its parochial school) as an instrument of assimilation, just as the Jews used education and the business world as points of entry. The Italians, by contrast, entrusted their fate to no outside institution.
The Italian family, in fact, served to maintain and perpetuate that immigrant sense of being on the fringe. In the Italian-American home of the first generation, the family spoke Italian, cooked Italian, married Italian and acted Italian. Acting Italian meant, quite simply, putting the family above all other interests. In many ways, the family unit operated much like a cork in a vast and turbulent sea: As a crucial survival device, it provided unusual psychological buoyancy and kept families afloat in periods of poverty and assaults on human dignity. But it also proved impermeable to outside influences, according to Richard Gambino, a historian, in his book ''Blood of my Blood.'' And this had negative ramifications as well for several generations.
The control of family destinies was in the hands of the father, a figure both feared and revered. A psychological profile of the traditional father, as it emerges in a recently published guide for psychological counselors, ''Ethnicity and Family Therapy,'' describes a ''benevolent despot'' who is authoritarian, rigid and highly committed to the notion of providing for - and protecting - his family. He demands respect from his wife and children, and regards defiance as ''an utterly intolerable insult.'' Out of compensation for a particular type of fatalism (a historical sense of lack of control over outside events), the authors of the chapter ''Italian American,'' Marie Rotunno and Monica McGoldrick, suggest, ''Italians emphasized the ability to maintain control over their own families.''
The Italian mother, in the view of authorities on Italian family structure, exerted considerable power and influence within the family, contrary to popular conception. She was considered the emotional heart of the group, and her responsibilities were prodigious. She ran the family's exchequer, the nursery, the infirmary, the kitchen, the cannery and a special domestic classroom that schooled the children in emotional loyalties, the principal one being the paramount importance of the family. This message was reinforced by the mother's manner, which was overprotective and intense, encouraging particularly tight bonds between mother and son. These inherited responsibilities, moral as well as economic and practical, were so overwhelming that second-generation Italians grew up with a heightened sense of familial obligation, which in turn occasioned unusual anxiety when it came to separation from family.  ''Sons were supposed to suffer shame and guilt for not following their fathers' ways,'' writes the psychohistorian Andrew Rolle, a professor of history at Occidental College in Los Angeles, in his book ''The Italian Americans: Troubled Roots.''
''The strong sense of respect for elders, for the mother and father, binds you until you fall into a pattern of 'what father wants, father gets,' '' says 66-year-old Mary Sansone, executive director of the Brooklyn-based Congress of Italian-Americans Organization, ''and it spills over into attitudes toward people in authority.'' The legacy, Mrs. Sansone notes in a sentiment echoed by others, is that ''Italian-Americans don't fight for things.''
That questioning of authority - whether social or familial - traditionally leaves Italians feeling uncomfortable. Marie Rotunno and Monica McGoldrick note that adolescence, for example, is an ''extremely stressful'' period for Italian families, and point out that separation from the family is so difficult and painful that traditional mileposts of achievement -marriage, a job promotion involving a transfer, or acceptance at an out-of-town university - is as likely to provoke crisis as celebration.
It may be, in fact, that Italian-American children in all but the most enlightened households trimmed the sails of their personal ambitions simply to avoid a conflict with the parents. A New York psychologist, Joseph Giordano, director of the American Jewish Committee's Louis Caplan Center on Group Identity and Mental Health, identifies the mixed messages of Italian families as ''Make it. Be successful. But don't go too far.''
''If you are inculcated with the values of a group, then to reject, to challenge, to give them up means a conflict of loyalty - a kind of disloyalty,'' says Rudolph J. Vecoli, professor of history at the University of Minnesota and and director of the Immigration History Research Center there. ''You're being untrue to your family, your parents and your ancestral heritage. That is true of many ethnic groups. But to make that break is perhaps more of a trauma for Italian-Americans than for others.'' Ironically, the other side of that fierce loyalty has contributed to the prevailing nightmare of Italian-American life: the Mafia. The same qualities that conferred great survivability on the Italians - loyalty to family, distrust of outsiders, strict adherence to codes of behavior and, in a phrase coined by Edward C. Banfield, professor of government at Havard University, the ''amoral familism'' that placed family ahead of society - also produced excellent criminals.  In kinship, says Francis A.J. Ianni, a historian of organized crime, ''the Italians had a cultural model that allowed them to control organized crime better and longer than anyone else.''
The secret bands known as ''mafie'' in 19th-century Sicily were usually agents of absentee landlords, and kept the peasantry in line. Other loose-knit groups of peasants formed outlaw bands and fought against oppressive landowners. According to the historian Humbert Nelli, it was probably the latter that, as immigrants in America, formed the turn-of-the-century Black Hand terrorist groups. Although historians are still unclear on the ties, if any, between the outlaws of the Old World and the criminals of the new, there is general agreement that the Mafia in America seemed to evolve out of Italian gangs that preyed on Italian immigrants in Italian neighborhoods, just as Irish and Jewish gangs developed in their respective ghettos. Familiarity with Mafia techniques in the older country (either first-hand or, more likely, by reputation) probably filtered through to the New World so that rackets such as paid protection that marked the old Sicilian mafie may have been adopted as effective tactics by American immigrant criminals. The ascendancy of Italian-Americans in the criminal underworld coincided, by historical accident, with the advent of Prohibition, when organized crime paid as never before: Petty extortionists and racketeers became millionaire bootleggers overnight. But the Prohi-bition gangs were never exclusively Italian, says Ralph Salerno, a former New York City Police Department supervisor of detectives in the organizedcrime unit; during this period, Italian, Irish and Jewish gangsters formed close working relationships that are still apparent today.
Despite the deep resentment that Italian-Americans feel about being linked with the Mafia (as well as the obvious truth that only a tiny minority are involved in illegal activity), many have never been particularly eager to dissociate the criminals from the law-abiders in their midst. Part of this may stem from a legitimate fear of the underworld. Many observers have pointed out that historically the Mafia has never shown any ethnic chauvinism and is just as likely to exploit Italian-Americans as any other group. And part may stem simply from the traditional Italian virtue of minding one's own business. ''You mind your own business because you don't want to get involved,'' says Donald Tricarico, assistant professor of social science at Queensboro Community College, who has studied the Italian community in Greenwich Village.''There's no recourse to the state and there's no protection.''
Although some people persist in the notion that the Mafia is merely a figment of the public's and the media's imagination, responsible Italian-Americans acknowledge the Italian-American role in organized crime - but with qualifications. ''I think it is folly for anyone in the Italian-American community to say there is not a small, small segment involved in crime,'' says Frank D. Stella, president of the National Italian-American Foundation. But Mr. Stella and others complain that the Mafia and organized crime have become synonymous, and that Italian-Americans have unfairly been identified as the core group of any criminal enterprise. These complaints are echoed by Thomas P. Puccio, one of a number of Italian-Americans who have established reputations as aggressive foes of organized crime.
''The public has been led to believe that organized crime and the Mafia were equivalent in every sense of the word,'' says Mr. Puccio, 38, former head of the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force for the Eastern District of New York and now a partner in the Park Avenue law firm of Fisher, Puccio & Wilker. ''It's very easy to say, 'O.K., the Mafia is the enemy.' It makes a nice neat little package. It sells. It's noncontroversial. You don't make any enemies. You don't step on anyone's toes. If you're running a Senate committee, you come out with names that look like a menu in an Italian restaurant, and you bring in people with bags over their heads. It's very, very simple.''
''The only problem with it,'' adds Mr. Puccio after a pause, ''is that even if you prosecuted every known member of the Mafia in this country, you're not going to put an end to organized crime to any significant degree.''
Italian hoodlums largely supplanted the Irish in the criminal world in the early years of the century, but Italians were utterly powerless to dislodge the Irish from another key element of immigrant life: the Roman Catholic Church. The tone of Irish-Italian religious relations was set in the 19th century, when Italian parishioners were routinely relegated to the basement of Irish churches for their services. They have never really managed to climb out.
Italians represent about 20 percent of the nation's Catholics, according to Lydio F. Tomasi, director of the Center for Migration Studies of New York. Yet until the elevation last February of Chicago Archbishop Joseph L. Bernardin to the status of cardinal, there had never been a single Italian-American cardinal in the history of the American church. Cardinal Bernardin, son of an immigrant stone cutter from the Trentino region of northern Italy, stands alone in the upper echelons of the church. According to a recent check based on The Official Catholic Directory, only 17 of the country's 309 bishops have Italian surnames; none of the 39 archbishops are Italian, and only one of the nine cardinals is Italian.
The standard explanation for this imbalance is that the Irish, with the head start of a generation and fluency in the language, were able to dominate the church hierarchy before the Italians began to arrive. The Irish often emigrated to the United States with their parish structure intact: The priest as well as teachers and townspeople transferred en masse to the New World, concentrating their power and providing a useful vehicle - the parochial school - to preach the gospel of assimilation.
Although many Italian Catholics now send their children to parochial schools, the exact opposite was true of the immigrant generation. They distrusted the church, as they distrusted most outside institutions. The experience of southern Italian peasants in particular had schooled them in a deep, visceral anticlericalism. To the Italians, Irish Catholicism seemed to be severe, doctrinaire, unemotional and conservative; to the Irish, Italian Catholics were excessively superstititious, overly influenced by folk customs, fatalistic, almost pagan.
Many Italian-Americans feel they were discouraged from entering or advancing in the church. ''The ethnic wars were very much the thing in the previous generation,'' says James A. Serritella, a former seminarian who now serves as the attorney for the Archdiocese of Chicago. ''The Italians were very religious, but in the early generations they did not have great affection for the clergy. The Irish were Anglo-Saxon when they got here: They built institutions, like the church, and worked through them. The Italians built families, and worked through them.'' Indeed, the relative paucity of Italian-American priests can in part be explained by the horror with which Italian-American parents viewed the loss of a good able-bodied male to religious life.
Church officials regarded the faith of the Italian immigrants as suspect - they had the reputation, according to scholars, of focusing on the pageantry of weddings, funerals and baptisms while ignoring the obligations of religious observance such as attending mass regularly and contributing money to the church. One sociologist comments that Italian-Americans took the church with ''half a ton of salt,'' and so were not receptive to the messages of the Irish church. Msgr. Geno Baroni, a former Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, recalls that his father, an immigrant miner from northern Italy, always wondered why so many sermons in their hometown parish of Acosta, Pa., were directed to the issues of liquor and sex. ''He never saw that as a problem,'' Monsignor Baroni says with a laugh. ''But the church was predominantly Irish, and those were apparently issues for them.'' Nor was Monsignor Baroni immune from the influence: Local nuns frequently advised him to change his name from Geno to the more Hibernian Kevin for confirmation.
Monsignor Baroni, now based in the Archdiocese of Washington, says he was not unaware of the Irish domination in the church, but can cite no specific incident of discrimination. ''No one tried to stop me because I was Italian,'' he says, ''but I was always sensitive to it.'' In their climb out of the ethnic ghettos and into the suburbs, the second generation had the bitter luxury of choices - painful choices. In many cases, Italian-Americans were forced to choose mutually exclusive avenues of conformity: either to family values (which perpetuated the old order) or to societal values (which abided by the melting-pot principle).
In those days, just as the Irish and Germans had before, it was deemed desirable and healthy to allow one's ethnic uniqueness to boil away in a cauldron of American conformity. And indeed, many Italians - to cite Geno Baroni's term - were ''accommodationists.'' They boiled the vowels off the end of their names, they abandoned their roots, they repudiated their families and their past. That is one reason, in fact, why estimates of the Italian-American population - anyone with ancestors born in Italy - vary so markedly, from 12 million to 25 million. It has been suggested that a large number of Italian-Americans decline to ''self-identify'' themselves as Italians, preferring to consider themselves only American.
United States District Court Judge John J. Sirica, who gained national prominence with his role in the Watergate investigation, typifies the old attitude when he addresses newly sworn-in citizens in his courtroom. ''I tell them: 'You must always be proud of your ethnic heritage, but now that you have sworn allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, you must now consider yourself American.' When I'm asked,'' he adds, ''I don't say I'm Italian. I say I'm American.''
Judge Sirica's childhood, interestingly, was fairly itinerant, as he lived a ''gypsy life'' with his family in various locations, and it appears that both geography and the size of local Italian populations greatly affected one's ability to break away from the family and establish an independent identity.
In areas of the country where Italians were few and the local population unsettled, such as the 19th-century California of A.P.  Giannini or the Texas of Jack Valenti's ancestors, Italians were quicker to enter the mainstream and quicker to assimilate. Mr.  Giannini established the Bank of Italy in San Francisco in 1904; now known as the Bank of America, it is the second-largest in the country. Other major West Coast companies - including Del Monte and Italian Swiss Colony - began as ideas in Italian immigrant minds.
The experiences of Mr. Valenti, who grew up in a mixed middleclass neighborhood in Houston, argues that the cultural density of Italian neighborhoods retarded rather than encouraged assimilation. ''I grew up in a distinctly non-Italian landscape,'' says Mr. Valenti, 61, whose grandparents, natives of Palermo, arrived in Galveston in 1885. ''If there had been 100,000 Italians in Houston, I probably would have moved in that group, and I would have felt uncomfortable outside it.'' Instead, Mr. Valenti mingled.  ''Early on,'' he recalls, ''my grandfather determined the grandchildren should not speak Italian. To his shrewd Sicilian mind, he realized that when you have to live with a majority, the best way to get along would be to mingle with that society. And you had to speak English to do that.'' Mr. Valenti eventually became a close aide of President Lyndon B. Johnson and now is president of the Motion Picture Association of America.
''Wherever you are reared, that stamps you for life,'' adds the author Gay Talese, who was raised in Ocean City, N.J., the son of immigrants from the Calabrian town of Maida. ''Being an outsider, an Italian-American in a small town, I became American very quickly - in language and in attitude and in distance from Italian-American culture. If I had grown up in the North End of Boston or in San Francisco, I'm sure I would have become a very different person.''
Distance, of course, is an aberrant quality to Italian-Americans precisely because it contradicts, and therefore threatens, the warmth and proximity so central to family survival. And yet distance is exactly what many second-generation Italian-Americans sought - distance from embarrassing ethnic rituals, distance from all the cultural idiosyncracies that contributed to a negative stereotype in the eyes of much of mainstream America.
Second-generation Italian-Americans in particular lived in a kind of psychological limbo. One of the great battlegrounds for this ambivalence occurred over the issue of education. To the first generation, the family was as likely to regard education as a kind of abrasive cultural agent that scrubbed away family values as to consider it a crucial vehicle for acculturation and advancement.  Census Bureau data from 1979, for example, indicate that education levels among individuals with two Italian parents ranked near the bottom among ethnic groups, while individuals with one Italian parent (that is, the products of intermarriage) ranked near the top.
Education is among the factors that account for the gradual and inexorable rise of Italian-Americans in American society. And, with the improved economic status of the second and third generations, the ties of the Italian family began to loosen enough to accommodate greater individual ambition. ''The Italian-American family tends to be more egaliatrian, more middle class now, and mobility is easier,'' notes Lydio F. Tomasi of New York's Center for Migration Studies.  ''It is easier for someone to move to another city to take a job in a corporation.''
While education was almost anathema to the first generation, second- and third-generation Italian-Americans are almost obsessive in seeking a quality education for their children. This attitude, which some observers date to the post-World War II years, has had a dramatic impact on the number of college-educated Italian-Amereicans.
Finally, there seems to be much less stigma attached to being Italian - in the eyes both of society as a whole and of the Italian-Americans themselves. This has translated not only into less prejudice, but also into a more confident self-image.
Education was crucial in the metamorphosis of Geraldine A. Ferraro from typical Italian daughter into Congresswoman, for she had to overcome that familial hostility to education - and to educated women. Although she received a scholarship from Marymount College, she had to fight to gain approval to attend, especially after an uncle in the extended family counseled her widowed mother: ''Why bother? She's pretty. She's a girl. She'll get married.''
Another likely explanation for the education gap is that firstgeneration Italians were survivalists, and survival in those days inevitably was interpreted in economic terms. Southern Italians, with a background of endless poverty, the vagaries of earthquakes, and political instability, perfected a kind of poor man's carpe diem: With their food and their feast days and their celebrations, they enjoyed the present and tended to have a constricted view ofthe future. For many, this meant skipping college and instead entering careers that promised quick payoffs and rapid advancement. ''A career as a pharmacist has clear and attainable rewards,'' says Richard N.  Juliani, associate professor of sociology at Villanova. ''But the guy who wants to take a Ph.D. in philosophy has a tough time explaining that to his family.''
In the first generation, they became construction workers and cobblers and tailors and bakers - if they managed to escape commonlaborer status. The second generation slowly expanded the horizon of career ambition to include jobs such as firemen, policemen and civil servants. Training for the professions was rare; careers in academia were rarer still.
Thus, A. Bartlett Giamatti, president of Yale University, and John Lo Schiavo, president of the University of San Francisco, both respected educators, are anomalies in the Italian-American world, which still has been slow to penetrate intellectual and academic circles. ''In proportion to our numbers, certainly the word 'lagging' would be appropriate,'' says Dr. Edmund D. Pellegrino, who recently completed a four-year stint as president of Catholic University in Washington, and is currently professor of medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ''I'm thinking about academic achievement, fundamental research, scholarly endeavor and contributions to the intellectual foundations,'' he says. ''Just look at Nobel Prize winners. How many Italian-Americans are there?''
Only four. And all the Italian-Americans who have won Nobel Prizes came to the United States with reputations and careers already established. Prof. Salvador Luria of the biology department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and director of the Center for Cancer Research, has been a seminal force in molecular biology and is a 1969 Nobel laureate for his work in the physiology of medicine. He says that in 1940, when he arrived in the United States (he was originally from Turin), there was only a handful of Italian-American scientists. ''The main reason,'' says the 70-year-old scientist, who makes a point of stating that he does not think of himself as Italian-American, ''is that once immigrant groups become established, they get into the law or medicine or the priesthood, but not into science.''
Entry into all those fields, as well as politics was restricted by prejudice. Mr. Valenti, who early on abandoned his ambitions to run for public office but who later was a force in national politics, likened being Italian and Catholic in Texas to ''a fellow having a harelip or a high, squeaky voice - it was just one of those handicaps that make it difficult for you.''
Anti-Italian prejudice continues to be a factor, according to some, although it is less pronounced than it was a generation ago, when a faculty counselor at St. John's University assured Edmund Pellegrino (a summa cum laude, double major, with a string of academic awards) that he would get into medical school - if he changed his last name.  The Order Sons of Italy in America believes that same bias accounts for under-representation in the executive suite. A recent survey of the nation's 800 largest corporations revealed that only 3.2 percent of board members or executives had Italian surnames. ''For the percentage of the population that we are,'' says Matthew Nizza, head of the organization's Commission for Social Justice, ''we really don't have our proper status in the larger corporations.'' People such as Benjamin F. Biaggini, chairman of Southern Pacific, and Emil J. (Buzzie) Bavasi, executive vice president of the California Angels baseball team, indicate, however, that some Italian-Americans have had long-running engagements in the executive suite.
Italian-Americans are rarely thought of as rights activists, but Eleanor Cutri Smeal makes it clear that her early exposure to anti-Italian bias, as well as the attitudes of her enlightened mother, influenced her later devotion to women's rights. ''If everything in life has been according to Hoyle, it's hard for some people to believe that discrimination exists,'' says the 43-year-old Mrs. Smeal. ''But if you've seen discrimination on another level, you know it exists. My whole family background was to make things better for the next generation, and that's what I feel we're doing in the women's movement.' If political success represents some ultimate referendum on ethnic acceptability, then Italian-Americans are unquestionably better off than a generation ago. In 1948, when Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, was first elected to the House of Representatives, there were no Italians in the Senate and only about half a dozen in the House. Now in his 18th term, Mr. Rodino is the elder statesman of an Italian delegation that numbers 29 representatives and four senators. And New York now has Italian-Americans as Governor, Lieutenant Governor (Alfred B.  DelBello), and junior Senator (Alfonse M. D'Amato).
More important, the political climate has sufficiently evolved so that Italian-Americans are now commonly mentioned for national office. There is hopeful -though hardly implausible -talk for the first time of sending one to Washington, either as President or Vice President.
At the moment of their election last November, Mr. Cuomo and Gov.  Richard Celeste of Ohio became Democrats of national prominence.  Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has been mentioned as a possible national candidate. And Geraldine A. Ferraro, the third-term Congresswoman from Queens, served as deputy national chairman of Jimmy Carter's re-election campaign during her first term in Congress and is widely regarded as a bright spot on the Democratic Party horizon.
But true to its roots, Italian-American politics reveals it-self as a paradoxical world where no single issue (such as Israel for the Jews) holds the center together and where blood does not always run as thick as party glue.
Italian-Americans have historically been known as working-class Democrats, but that distinction is becoming increasingly fuzzy: They supported Ronald Reagan in 1980 by a margin of 50 to 38, according to ABC News exit polls. This is read as evidence of an increasingly suburban, middle-class, family-oriented bloc of voters - the same constituency that sent Mr. D'Amato to the Senate in 1980.
But the Italian-Americans have also been accused of failing to support their own. That tendency accounted for several interesting aspects of last fall's gubernatorial contest. Prior to the Democratic primary, Bronx Congressman Mario Biaggi made television commercials for Mr. Cuomo's opponent, New York Mayor Edward Koch; and prior to the general election, a letter of support signed by Mr. D'Amato was sent to tens of thousands of Italian-Americans statewide, urging them to vote for the Republican candidate, Lewis E. Lehrman.
Italian-Americans form the largest ethnic bloc in New York State, but they never acted the part until the Democratic gubernatorial primary last September. ''In the Cuomo election,'' says Salvatore J.  La Gumina, professor of history at Nassau Community College and a long-time student of Italian-American politics, ''they were able to utilize the electoral process in the primary to wrest the nomination away from the official party candidate.'' According to ABC News exit polls, Italian voters supported Mr. Cuomo by a margin of 64 to 35 over Mayor Koch in the primary and by 58 to 39 over Mr. Lehrman in the general election. Jewish voters, viewed as more steadfast Democrats, supported Mr. Cuomo over Mr. Lehrman by an even wider margin than the Italians, 63 to 36.
The campaign, not surprisingly, left a bitter aftertaste with some. ''I myself received a letter from D'Amato,'' complains Rocco Caporale, a sociology professor at St. John's University and head of the Institute for Italian American Studies. ''As an Italian-American, I was insulted. I don't see that esprit, that spirit of community, in the Italians as in the Jews. The Italians are gallant. They give away their votes. We come from a country that is terribly divided, distrustful of others - it has been a hallmark for centuries, and continues even today. We are incapable of cooperation.'' Indeed, it is often overlooked that Italy became a united country only recently in history; Italians identified with a local region, such as Sicily or the Abruzzzi, instead of a nation. This insularity was reinforced by a language that was split into so many dialects that some Italians could not communicate with fellow countrymen.
The prime force pushing for unanimity and cooperation is the National Italian American Foundation, founded in 1975 by Representative Frank Annunzio, Democrat of Illinois, former Secretary of Transportation John A. Volpe, Msgr. Geno Baroni and the Minnesota businessman Jeno F. Paulucci. The foundation promotes scholarship funds, conducts ethnic conferences and has lobbied for increased representation of Italian-Americans in Cabinet-level positions, ambassadorial posts and judgeships -particularly an appointment to the Supreme Court.
''It's high time that Italian-Americans were considered - or pushed themselves ahead - for these high positions,'' says the blunt-talking Mr. Paulucci, 64-year-old son of immigrants whose Italian frozenfoods company and other business interests now make him worth a reported $150 million. ''Politically, they appoint Jews, blacks and so forth. Why not Italian-Americans? Why have we been excluded?''
Frank D. Stella, a Detroit businessman and current president of the foundation, says that President Reagan has in fact appointed three Italian-Americans to high-ranking judgeships and placed 21 in what he calls ''high-level'' positions, such as Associate Attorney General Rudolph W. Giuliani (recently nominated to be United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York). But there was ill-concealed embarrassment and anger among many Italian-Americans when Mr. Reagan declined an invitation to the foundation's fourth biennial awards banquet last September.
Mr. Paulucci and others have repeatedly described the Italian-American voting bloc as a ''sleeping giant.'' Is it showing signs of stirring?
''When you are speaking of national campaigns, there's a good portion of Italian-Americans in states such as New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey,'' answers Representative Ferraro. ''These are states with a large number of electoral votes, where Italian-Americans can make a difference. Whether they will or not,'' she says, ''I don't know.''
The question may not be entirely moot. Recently, an Italian journalist asked Mr. Cuomo about his Presidential aspirations in 1988. At first the Governor demurred with the Italian phrase ''Pian piano'' - roughly, ''One thing at a time.'' But he also recalled a favorite proverb of his mother, Immaculata: ''Chi va pian piano, non arriva mai.'' Translation: ''He who takes his time never arrives at all.'' If you had been out of the country for the last two decades, like Joseph V. Vittoria, the progress of Italian-Americans would hardly seem pian piano. ''When I came back from Europe,'' says Mr. Vittoria, president of Avis Inc. and former president of Hertz, ''I was almost overwhelmed by the growth of Italian influence. There was a tremendous increase in the Italian presence here.''
Perhaps the single most important change in Italian-Americans over that period is the way they perceive themselves. Self-esteem, once weighted down by ethnicity, now fairly soars in an atmosphere where cultural pluralism has supplanted the melting-pot ideal. A recent survey of 213 third-generation Italian-Americans in their early 30's, all of whom had grown up in the heavily Italian Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, revealed overwhelmingly positive feelings about their Italian roots. To the question ''Would you change your ethnic identity?'' not a single person in the sample said yes - a possibility almost inconceivable a generation ago. ''This is a group,'' says Carmela Sansone-Pacelli, who conducted the survey, ''that has come a long way.''
And that is what William D'Antonio learned, in a more personally profound way, last fall. Mr. D'Antonio, executive officer of the American Sociological Association, visited his two college-age daughters on successive weekends. At the University of Vermont, his daughter Raissa told about a psychology paper she had written on the theme ''Five Things I Like About Myself''; one of those things was that she liked being Italian. Mr. D'Antonio reacted with surprise: ''You said that?''
The following weekend, he visited his daughter Laura at Yale.  ''I'm the only 100 percent Italian in my dorm,'' she announced at one point, ''but I know at least a dozen people who wish they were Italian.'' This final observation had double significance for Mr.  D'Antonio. Forty years ago, he was a struggling, self-conscious scholarship freshman at Yale himself, steeped in ambivalence about his ethnic background. To put it simply, he was ashamed to be Italian.  ''In 1943, I would not have been able to admit that I was Italian, much less imagine any dozen people who wished they were Italian,'' he muses now, still shaking his head at the novelty of the thought. ''It really does signify a change in how we think about ourselves.''

Immigration1.0-35936,JUSTICE DEPT. CONSIDERS POSSIBLE APPEAL OF SENTENCES IN TEXAS SLAVE CASE,1984,2,new york times,By LESLIE MAITLAND WERNER,section 1,919.0,"The Justice Department said today that it was studying whether it could appeal what it considered excessively light sentences given to two Texas men convicted of holding 19 Mexican workers in slavery.
The men were convicted by a jury in Texas after testimony that they bought the aliens from a broker for $50 each, forced them at gunpoint to live in a tiny, unheated shack without windows or toilets, and made them work morning to night for no pay and little food.
The defendants, Steven Crawford and Randall Craig Waggnor, were convicted on more than a dozen counts, including conspiracy, transportation of illegal aliens, and forcing the aliens into involuntary servitude. They had faced possible sentences of 95 years in prison and fines of $70,000.
US Justice Department is studying whether to appeal what it considers excessively light sentences given to Texas residents Steven Crawford and Randall Craig Waggnor, who have been convicted of holding 19 Mexican workers in slavery; both testified they bought aliens from broker for $50 each, forced them at gunpoint to live in shack and made them work for no pay and little food; Federal District Judge William M Steger sentenced them to five years' probation and fines (M)
On Monday, Federal District Judge William M. Steger in Tyler, Tex., sentenced the men to five years' probation and fined them $1,000 each. The same sentence was also imposed on a third defendant, Joe Gonzales, who had pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution.

Judge Faults Border Guards
''We are very, very disappointed in the sentences,'' Criselda Ortiz, a lawyer for the Justice Department's civil rights division, who was prosecutor in the case, said in an interview today. She said Judge Steger did not allow her to recommend a sentence.
Miss Ortiz said Judge Steger contended in court that the fault lay with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, which failed to prevent the Mexicans from illegally crossing into this country.
Regarding the possibility of an appeal, Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who heads the civil rights division, said today, ''We are looking at that question, but at the present time it does not appear to be an option that's available to us.''
The Government is virtually barred under the law from appealing a sentence. Any appeal would have to focus not on the sentences imposed by Judge Steger, but on his refusal to allow Miss Ortiz to make a statement regarding the Government's views on the possible sentences for the defendants.

Rules Permit Statement
Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure the defendant must be permitted to speak ''to present any information in mitigation of punishment,'' his lawyer must be permitted to speak on his behalf, and ''the attorney for the Government shall have an equivalent opportunity to speak to the court.''
''I had no chance to make a recommendation,'' Miss Ortiz said. ''The lawyers for Crawford and Waggnor spoke, but I was prohibited. The record will show that Judge Steger threatened to hold me in contempt if I persisted in speaking. I tried to speak several times and he ordered me not to.''
Judge Steger, a 63-year-old Republican who was named to the Federal District Court bench for eastern Texas in 1970, could not be reached for comment today. His secretary, Evelyn Walker, said, ''I don't believe he would care to comment,'' adding that he had declined other inquiries. ''He is ill at home,'' she said, ''and cannot be reached.''
But Weldon Holcomb, Mr. Crawford's lawyer, said, ''I believe this was the proper sentence, based on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.''

'Trying to Get Ahead'
Mr. Holcomb noted that Mr. Crawford was 21 years old, and Mr. Waggnor 22, a factor he said the judge had considered.
''He was trying to get ahead,'' Mr. Holcomb said of his client. ''The young men just used bad judgment.''
But Mr. Holcomb was critical of Mr. Gonzales, saying it had been disclosed during the trial that the Government's witness had acted as a ''human broker'' several times before, in other parts of the state.
''The Mexicans on the border just sell these people like cattle,'' the lawyer said.
The Mexicans, all illegal aliens who had crossed the border in search of employment, had agreed to work in the defendants' pine tree planting business in exchange for $25 a day plus room and board.
They were kept, sometimes at rifle point, in an unheated, 14-by-20-foot shack without windows, sufficient beds or blankets, or any bathroom or toilet facilities, Miss Ortiz said. When some risked escape, she said, they were recaptured at gunpoint.
According to Miss Ortiz, the case began on Feb. 10, 1983, when Mr. Gonzales gathered the 19 Mexicans, ranging in age from 16 to 48, in Rocksprings, Tex. He had arranged for them to work for Mr. Crawford, who held contracts with the State Department of Forestry to plant pine trees in Center, Tex., near the border with Louisiana.
According to Miss Ortiz, Mr. Waggnor paid Mr. Gonzales $950 for the aliens.  She said Mr. Waggnor placed them in a 5-foot-by-8-foot trailer where she said they were so crowded they had no room to sit down. They drove for 500 miles, she said, and when they arrived were put immediately to work. ''They were told they had to work two weeks without pay in order to pay for their ride to the farm,'' Miss Ortiz said.
After several days of being forced to work at gunpoint, the aliens escaped and persuaded a shopkeeper to call the police.  The Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Department of Labor, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Texas were all called into the case.
Miss Ortiz recalled that the jury deliberated for just 90 minutes before it convicted Mr. Crawford and Mr. Waggnor.
All the Mexican workers involved will be deported.

Immigration1.0-35816,MAZZOLI BILL IS NOT HELPING AT HOME,1984,6,new york times,By JAMES BARRON,section a,698.0,"One thing about a city 373 miles from the nearest foreign border is that immigration is not a hot topic on the local cocktail circuit. So while Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, a Democrat, has been in the news for writing the immigration bill the House passed last week, his constituents here have been talking about Cissy and the college degrees.
Cissy is the nickname for Elaine Musselman, a 40-year-old Republican whose aggressive campaign against Mr. Mazzoli had attracted Democrats and women. They did not see much value for the district in Mr. Mazzoli's immigration work, his first major piece of legislation in 14 years in the House, and did not share his strong antiabortion views.
Article on campaign between Rep Romano L Mazzoli, who wrote immigration reform legisation, and Elaine Musselman, Republican who is challenging him for House seat in Louisville, Ky, election; Musselman has attracted attention because of disclosure that she never received two college degrees she said she held; illustrations (M)
But three weeks ago a television station disclosed that Miss Musselman, the head of an insurance company who is a former president of the Louisville Chamber of Commerce, had never received the two college degrees she had said she held.
That same week, after attending a fund-raising party in Washington, she lost control of a rented automobile she was driving and suffered a concussion and a neck injury.

A Lull in Campaign
With Mr. Mazzoli in Washington to shepherd the immigration bill through the House and Miss Musselman recuperating out of town, there was a lull in the campaign that lasted until today, when Miss Musselman came home for the first time since the accident.
In a statement to 50 supporters at the Louisville airport, she called her misstatements about her educational background ''a foolish and immature mistake'' that she had made to get her first job, as a lobbyist with the Bristol- Myers Company in Washington. She said the company had kept her on the payroll after discovering that she did not have a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Louisville and a masters in international relations from American University in Washington, as she had asserted.
Saul Loeb, her campaign spokesman, said that she had not decided whether to continue the race and that her decision would depend on her health.
''Everything that's happened has brought back Ron's basic virtues,'' said Russell Riggs, a Louisville lawyer who is a former local Democratic chairman. ''His hard work didn't appeal to trendy people, and he'd lost some of them.''
The district hugs the Ohio River and includes this city of Louisville and the powerful, wealthy suburbs to the east, where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by 3 to 1. Mr. Mazzoli, who is 51 years old, won his seat in 1970 by running as the peace candidate in what was seen as a referendum on the Vietnam War.

Stand on Rights Amendment
Mr. Mazzoli is a Roman Catholic and has consistently opposed abortion. But until last year he had generally supported the proposed equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution. Karen Bybee, his spokesman in Washington, said he cast a no vote last November because he disapproved of the procedures used to bring the amendment to the floor.
''When he voted against the E.R.A., a lot of women were disturbed,'' said Lucretia Ward, coordinator of the 1,500-member Women's Alliance, who is a member of the Kentucky Commission on Women.
As for immigration, some of Mr. Mazzoli's constituents are not sure that the Government can administer Mr. Mazzoli's bill. ''It sounds like it will be a real bureaucratic wingding,'' said Betty Ann Miller, a Democrat.
His sudden national prominence has made some people in Louisville wonder whether he is more in touch with affairs in Washington than with his district. ''I don't care how many weekends you fly back,'' Mr. Riggs said, ''it's not like living there.''
Miss Musselman, by contrast, had become a visible community leader and was planning a well-financed campaign. Mr. Loeb said she had expected to raise $500,000. Whether she can raise that much now is an open question. So is whether she can still defeat Mr. Mazzoli.
''The public has an enormous capacity to forgive, but this is like the Tylenol case,'' said Jessica Schikler, a partner in a Louisville advertising company who was an early Musselman supporter. To turn something like this around takes great skill and total honesty.''

Immigration1.0-35037,MEXICANS OPPOSE U.S. ENTRY CURBS,1982,11,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section 1,893.0,"Business and political leaders in Mexico have told the United States that passage of a comprehensive immigration bill now pending in Congress would seriously harm relations between the two countries and ''foster political unrest'' if it was effectively enforced.
In a dispatch to Washington, the United States Ambassador to Mexico, John Gavin, said it was the unanimous opinion of Mexican leaders interviewed by the embassy that the consequences of the legislation would be ''highly unfavorable for the U.S. economy and for U.S.-Mexican relations.''
Illegal aliens sent back to Mexico and would-be migrants unable to cross the border ''would foster political unrest with potentially explosive consequences, businessmen here told us,'' Mr. Gavin reported.
With the Mexican economy in distress, the peso in turmoil and a new President set to take office on Dec. 1, Mr. Gavin said, many Mexicans believe this would be a particularly inauspicious time for the United States to tighten its immigration law.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 - Business and political leaders in Mexico have told the United States that passage of a comprehensive immigration bill now pending in Congress would seriously harm relations between the two countries and ''foster political unrest'' if it was effectively enforced.Bill Awaits House Action
The bill, sponsored by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, a Kentucky Democrat, has passed the Senate and is awaiting possible House floor action in the special session of Congress that starts Nov. 29.
Supporters of the bill, seizing on concern over unemployment, say it would open one million to two million jobs for American citizens.  The heart of the bill is a system of fines and prison terms for employers who knowingly hire illegal aliens. The bill would also offer legal status to several million illegal aliens who entered the United States before 1980.
''Probably between one and two million Mexicans would be forced to return to Mexico at the one moment'' in its history when ''Mexico is least capable of generating additional employment,'' Mr. Gavin wrote.
The ambassador's 17-page report drew on conversations with Mexican officials, businessmen, economists, journalists and academics, including ''scholars affiliated with the Government.''
The State Department's chief spokesman on immigration, Assistant Secretary Diego C. Asencio, said in an interview Friday that ''we've been talking to the Mexicans, we've been listening to them and we have attempted to take their concerns into account as much as we could.'' The Reagan Administration has strongly supported the bill, saying it would permit the United States to re-establish control of its borders.

Patrols Would Be Increased
The bill declares the sense of Congress that there should be a carefully controlled ''increase in border patrol and other enforcement activities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.'' But from Mexico, Mr. Gavin reported that ''effective enforcement of this measure is seen to require authoritarian measures amounting to a militarization of the border zone.''
If there is a substantial reduction in money sent home by Mexican workers in the United States, Mr. Gavin said, the standard of living in some agricultural regions of Mexico could ''plummet to belowsubsistence levels.''
''At the national level,'' he said, ''lower remittance incomes would deplete the Bank of Mexico's dollar reserves and aggravate mounting debt payment difficulties.'' By further depressing the value of the peso, he said, ''these developments would fuel inflation, which in 1982 has risen to the highest levels'' in 50 years.
Some Mexicans contend that the ''economic dislocations'' would be ''more damaging to the United States than to Mexico,'' Mr. Gavin said. According to this view, ''border zone employers, already suffering sizable market losses due to this summer's devaluations, would be dealt the additional blow of losing their principal source of low-wage labor.''

'Second-Class Citizenship' Seen
Mr. Simpson and Mr. Mazzoli say that by granting amnesty to illegal aliens, they would eliminate an illegal subclass of people who have been exploited by American employers. But Mr. Gavin said this proposal was seen as ratifying ''second-class citizenship for Mexicans,'' because they would have to pay taxes in the United States while being ineligible for most social welfare benefits.
United States officials said that Mr. Gavin's description of Mexican attitudes was invaluable because, as the ambassador said, the official Mexican policy on illegal migration has been a ''policy of silence.''
Mexicans ''see the migration problem as deeply embedded in the structure of an international labor market that unites the two countries,'' Mr. Gavin said. ''These economic forces, characterized as a 'push' from Mexico and a much stronger 'pull' from the United States, defy legal attempts to modify them.''
Thus, he said, ''Mexicans are deeply pessimistic that Simpson-Mazzoli can be enforced.'' They ''commonly assume that the U.S. economy's demand for foreign labor is ineradicable, even in a recession; and many maintain a Marxist world-view leading them to believe business interests dominate Congress, and thus would never allow Congress to pass or enforce stiff employer sanctions.''

Immigration1.0-35030,NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,1982,11,new york times,By Albert J Parisi,section 11,1567.0,"REDUCTIONS in the number of firefighters in many of the state's paid Fire Departments have resulted in a sharp increase in fatalities involving civilians trapped in fires and an increase in injuries to the firemen who attempt to rescue them, according to the New Jersey State Firemen's Mutual Benevolent Association.
The union, which represents members of about 70 paid departments in the state, as opposed to volunteer departments, is acquiring figures from the various municipalities that show their total number of fires, how many firemen there are in their departments and of fatalities and injuries to civilians and uniformed men over the last five or six years.
Union officials hope to be able to persuade the public and the various communities to put the departments back at full strength.  They also hope to persuade the Legislature to adjust the ceiling on increases in a municipality's annual budget so that funds will be available for more firefighters.
New Jersey Journal discusses several news stories from New Jersey
Thus far, the results of the union's survey appear to bolster its contentions. The survey compares Fire Department statistics for 1977-1979 with those for 1980, when reductions in force began across the state, and 1981.
In Elizabeth, the figures supplied by the firemen's association show that in 1980, when the department had 20 fewer men, there were about 300 fewer fires than in the previous year. However, the number of civilian fatalities jumped from three in 1979 to 10 in 1980, and the number of injuries to firemen almost doubled, going from 80 reported in 1979 to 145 in 1980.
The loss in dollars in Elizabeth rose by almost $1.8 million from 1979 to 1980, and the requests for help from surrounding communities soared from five in 1979 to 25 a year later.
In 1981, when 10 men were restored to the Fire Department ranks, civilian deaths in Elizabeth dropped to eight and injuries to firefighters declined to 77.
In Passaic, 147 firemen were employed in 1977, a figure that dropped to 125 in 1979 and to 98 this year. Civilian deaths in the period increased by 167 percent, going from one a year in 1977-78 to an average of 2.67 a year in 1979-81.
Injuries to Passaic firemen increased 32 percent, rising to 36.3 a year in the 1979-81 period, and requests for mutual aid jumped by almost 94 percent, reaching 16.5 calls a year in 1980-81, as compared to 8.5 requests in 1977-79.
In Paterson, where, association officials said, major manpower reductions began last year, civilian deaths increased by 43.9 percent. They rose to an average of 14 a year in 1980-81, as compared to 9.75 a year in 1977-79, while injuries to firefighters went up 21 percent. Property losses there rose to $6.3 million last year, as compared to $4.1 million annually in the earlier period (1977-79).
Paterson's firefighting force was reduced in two steps, going from 361 in 1977 to 320 in 1981 and to 243 this year, according to the association.
Other communities in which the number of firemen was reduced also showed higher loss rates.  In Clifton, Millburn, North Plainfield and Union City, the number of civilian deaths has remained constant, while injuries and property losses have increased.
According to union officials, those communities that have maintained their manpower at a constant level, such as Springfield, Union, Summit and Cranford, do not show as dramatic an increase in deaths, injuries or costs as in towns that reduced their departments.
A veritable shoppers' paradise in Newark - the remnants of a historic farmers' market along a three-block stretch of Mulberry Street, a market where products are fresh and the prices are low -is in its final throes. The market is being forced to make way for construction of the Prudential Insurance Company's new office building.
The stores are just off Market Street, which got its name from the vegetable stalls there. Although the 23 vegetable, meat and fish stores are not in the path of construction, their presence - with vegetable stands that cover half the sidewalk, boxes of melting ice still carrying the smell of fish and delivery trucks that constrict traffic - detracts from the area.
The owners and operators of the stores, many of which have been at their present locations for almost 30 years and which employ more than 300 people, have been told that they must get out by Aug. 1.
In the meantime, they have been rallying hundreds of their customers in an attempt to delay their eviction. They hope to create a groundswell of support from the thousands of people who have shopped at their stores so that the city will let them stay.
City officials have proposed that the stores move to a new location - the old Jersey Central Railroad station on Broad Street - but the $2 million-plus cost of renovating that structure will make rents prohibitive and will force some of the stores to close permanently.
Newark officials have produced the first computerized listing of the 5,500 properties owned by the city and can now decide more easily which properties to sell, which to retain for development and which to demolish or renovate.
The listing shows that, of the city-owned parcels, many of which were taken in foreclosure for non-payment of taxes, 3,900 are now vacant lots, 800 are abandoned buildings awaiting demolition and 100 are paved parking lots. About 500 of the buildings are occupied, with 60 percent of them residential and the rest commercial.
The list also includes 200 properties used by the municipal government, such as firehouses, police stations and garages.  Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson, who was sworn in for a fourth term on July 1, said that the city was trying to formalize its relationships with the tenants in the buildings and has begun eviction proceedings against those who are unwilling or unable to pay rent.
The Mayor said it was difficult to get an accurate count of the tenants from whom the city can collect rent because many people living in the buildings were squatters and others have simply become accustomed to not paying rent.
A network of neighborhood crime-prevention centers has been established at about 350 convenience food stores throughout the state. The program, which is a joint effort of the New Jersey Crime Prevention Officers Association and the New Jersey Convenience Stores Associaition, will provide monthly crime-prevention tips to customers of 7-Eleven Stores, Hubbard's Cupboards, Wawa Food Stores and the Heritage Dairy Stores.
ODDS & ENDS: The Central New Jersey Transportation Board, a commuters' group representing Route 9 bus riders, has set up a ''hot line'' so that commuters can complain about buses that are not airconditioned. The number - (201) 462-7908 -will be staffed by volunteers from 6 to 8 P.M. so that the weary, overheated commuter can get his complaint in before he reaches for that cooling drink.  … After almost a decade of delays, the state will soon start to replace the 30th Street Bridge in Bayonne. The bridge, which spans railroad tracks and connects Avenue E to the city's largely industrial East Side, has been in disrepair, and the on-again, offagain plans have finally jelled. The state has announced that bids will be sought Thursday.

Immigration1.0-35030,NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,1982,11,new york times,By Albert J Parisi,section 11,1567.0,"THE state's politicians have had their share of problems in recent years, with members of Congress ousted after bribery investigations, mayors brought before grand juries and freeholders jailed for irregularities. Now Passaic is about to recall its Mayor and then reelect him.
Enough petitions have been signed by voters to ask for the recall of Mayor Robert Hare on the charge that he mismanaged municipal affairs. The leader of the recall movement is City Council President Joseph Lipari, who lost to Mr. Hare in last year's election.
As things now stand, in a vote Oct. 5 the people are to decide whether Mr. Hare, who is serving a second term, should be recalled.  At the same time, they will be voting for a new Mayor, with Mr. Hare and Mr. Lipari as candidates. Observers in the city say that the chances are good that Mr. Hare will win, thus being possibly recalled and re-elected on the same day.
New Jersey Journal column discusses petition to recall Passaic (NJ) Mayor Robert Hare and highlights other current events in New Jersey area
There is another bit of Passaic political byplay. Mr. Lipari ran for election as a Councilman two years ago, although he still had two years to serve on his term. He won and for a *%time found that he held two seats on the City Council. Eventually, th e other Council members agreed to name a replacement to complete t he two years of Mr. Lipari's first term.
The story doesn't end there. In the**x*t 15 years Passaic has had three changes of government, from commission to city manager-council to mayor-council. Turnover in city managers and business administrators has been unmatched in the state. In addition, recall petitions have been circulated many times in the past.
A special gymnastic society, the turnverein, is celebrating its 125th year in Carlstadt, continuing a tradition that was started by immigrants from Germany. The societies were organized because parents believed that their children were not getting enough physical fitness training in the public schools.
Turnvereins were popular in New Jersey for many years, with more than 25 across the state. But as the public schools improved their physical education programs the societies were forced to close for lack of funds and enrollment. Even so, the Carlstadt group has thrived, raising the $16,000 it needs each year from membership dues, donations and promotional events.
Ewald Heckmann, president of the Carlstadt society, said that it had been able to survive because it was fortunate enough to ''have our own home,'' Turn Hall. The group built the hall in 1900 at the corner of Broad and Monroe Streets.
''The most important thing in any gymnastic society or one our size is to have a hall and a home for activities,'' Mr. Heckmann said.  ''If you have to rent one or you depend on others, you're never going to make it. There's no way you can ever make enough money to pay the rent.''
What makes a turnverein work?  Trudy Bartels, a gymnastics coach, said: ''It's word-of-mouth advertising. People enjoy themselves here, and they tell friends.'' Today there are 400 members in the Carlstadt society. Miss Bartels believes that interest in gymnastics has intensified since the emergence of Olympic stars such as Kathy Rigby, Olga Korbut and Nadia Comaneci.
''Gymnastics is not a sport where you can horse around,'' she said. ''You have to take it seriously, otherwise there will be an injury.  We're doing it to let the kids have a taste of what it's all about.''
Pointing out that ''we are more of a social group,'' Mr. Heckmann said the society was also stressing cultural events. ''Good music and gyming are good things for your life,'' he added.
''If you think about it,'' Miss Bartels said, ''where could you possibly go where the membership goes from age 3 up through all ages, male and female?''
Officials of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University, having spent seven years analyzing data, have concluded that sex selection of newborn children will become a popular technology in the next decade.
Charles F. Westoff, a demographer with the office, said that a poll taken in 1975 and recently fully analyzed, showed that 45 percent of 3,400 women randomly selected from across the country said they would rather have a boy first. If a woman had only one child, he said, the trend to opt for a son first could result in ''a predominance of males.''
Mr. Westoff said the survey did not attempt to determine why the women preferred a son first. ''It doesn't make sense in terms of longevity, but it goes back to a frontier or an agrarian tradition of wanting a boy to work on the farms,'' he said. ''It's just one of those things that persist, although it is not universal.''
The survey also found that 35 percent of those who answered said they would rather not select the sex of their children despite indications that sex-selection methods would be widely available in about 10 years.
With the demise of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women nationally, New Jersey's colleges are setting up an organization of their own to promote competition. The new league will be called the Jersey Athletic Conference and will be open to institutions that have at least three varsity sports programs for women.
''We will have a double round of play, home and away games, in basketball, and we'll also have doubleheaders in softball,'' said Dr. Pearl Kowalski, women's athletic director at Glassboro State College who was a leader in forming the new conference. ''We will follow N.C.A.A. rules and we also have asked for an automatic berth in the N.C.A.A. tournament in basketball and softball.''
The national organization ran out of funds and had to shut down, but the New Jersey conference will continue to sponsor state meets in cross-country and track and state tournaments in tennis and gymnastics, according to Dr. Kowalski. ''Right now, it isn't much of a conference in those four sports,'' she said, ''but we hope to grow.''
Besides Glassboro, the members of the new conference are Trenton State, William Paterson, Kean, Stockton, Rutgers Camden and Montclair State. All are expected to field women's softball teams and, except for Montclair, will participate in basketball. In other sports, some of the schools have indicated that they will be unable to field teams during the first year of the conference, but there will be enough available to allow for intercollegiate competition.
Postseason playoffs in softball and basketball are envisaged, since those sports have the greatest participation. Only four schools have agreed to join cross-country competition and three in track, gymnastics and lacrosse. All will offer tennis teams except Stockton.
Pat Hannish of Kean is the first president of the conference.

Immigration1.0-35030,NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,1982,11,new york times,By Albert J Parisi,section 11,1567.0,"THE Essex County Courthouse in Newark has the dubious distinction of having two criminal trials of major political figures going on at the same time. Last Monday, on the fifth floor of the courthouse, the trial of Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark and his co-defendant, former City Council President Earl Harris, on charges of conspiracy and misconduct in office got under way with jury selection.
At the same time, but on the eighth floor, pretrial arguments on the admissibility of recordings of telephone conversations were being heard in the case of State Senator John T. Gregorio. The 56-year-old lawmaker, who also has been Mayor of Linden since 1967, is charged with conspiracy, tax evasion, tampering with records and misconduct in connection with two go-go bars in Linden in which he is alleged to have had a hidden interest.
In an 11-count indictment, Mr. Gregorio is accused of splitting $64,000 in income from the bars with the manager of the establishments.
New Jersey Journal highlights various brief news stories concerningNew Jersey
The trials have generated a good deal of interest, with that of Mayor Gibson and Mr. Harris far overshadowing that of Senator Gregorio.
Mr. Gregorio is the fourth Democratic State Senator in less than two years to face trial. Former Senators Angelo J.Errichetti of Camden, David J.Friedland of Jersey City and William V.Musto of Union City were convicted in separate trials in Federal courts.
The presence of television cameras in both courtrooms during the current trials has been approved. The Gibson-Harris trial is expected to last about six weeks, the Gregorio trial more than two months.
Mayor Gibson and Mr. Harris are accused of knowingly and illegally permitting Michael A.Bontempo, a former Newark City Councilman, to collect more than $115,000 in salary over a seven-year period while serving as head of security for the city's 35,000-acre Pequannock Watershed. The facility is the source of Newark's drinking water.
Specifically, Mr. Gibson and Mr. Harris are accused of having created a job for Mr. Bontempo and allowing him to collect a salary even though he allegedly did little, if any, work. Mr. Bontempo, who is a co-defendant in the case but whose trial was severed because of his failing health, is 81 years old. He allegedly lived in Port St.  Lucie, Fla., during part of the time that he was on the city payroll.
Disclosure of the position came to light during a news conference called by Mayor Gibson to assess progress on repairs to the city's 22-mile aqueduct, which was crippled when vandals caused the 36-inch pipes to be undermined and rupture. The trial of the four youths accused of the vandalism is scheduled to start tomorrow.
The arduous task of selecting a jury to hear the charges against the 50-year-old, four-time Mayor and the 62-year-old former Council President was complicated by the judge's questioning each prospective juror in his chambers. The judge, Paul R. Huot, normally sits in Bergen County, but was assigned to this case by Chief Justice Robert N. Wilentz of the State Supreme Court.
Jurors were asked a series of 69 questions, ranging from whether they knew any of the participants in the case to whether they had any bias or prejudice concerning government, politicians, officials or employees of government that would prevent them from fairly, impartially and objectively evaluating the evidence.
The prospective jurors also were shown a list of more than 200 present and former government officials who might be called as witnesses. The list included Representatives Peter W. Rodino Jr. and Millicent Fenwick, as well as private citizens and business leaders.
The death of two men in a mid-air collision of two single-engine planes over Essex County Airport in Fairfield three weeks ago brought to five the number of fatalities resulting from crashes of light planes in the state this year. However, it is a marked decrease from the number of such fatalities that have occurred in recent years.
For instance, in 1981, 15 persons were killed in six of 79 lightaircraft accidents that year; in 1980, 25 persons were killed in 10 of 68 crashes.
Thus far this year, according to figures compiled by the state's Division of Aeronautics, an arm of the Department of Transportation, there have been 39 crashes of light aircraft. Among them was a fatal incident on Aug. 15, when a single-engine Beechcraft crashed into a grove of trees near Mercer County Airport, killing the three persons aboard.
Aeronautics officials credit safety programs instituted by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board with the reduction in crashes and fatalities.
In the Essex County Airport incident, the collision - it involved a four-seat Cessna 172 and a two-seat Cessna 150 - occurred while one of the men who died in the crash was undergoing one of the safety procedures, a biennial review of his flying ability.
According to government officials, the man, Haynesley Thomas, 40, of Brooklyn, was being checked out by Carlos Rodriguez, 27, a flight instructor from Passaic. The two men had taken off from Teterboro Airport and were given clearance to conduct ''touch and go'' takeoffs and landings at Essex County Airport.
Both died when their plane collided with one being flown by Mario Diaz, 32, of Irvington, who also had been given clearance to conduct similar landings and takeoffs.
An investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board said that the plane carrying Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Thomas was slightly off course at the time, and had been warned of an impending collision a split second before contact.
The American Automobile Association has stepped up its campaign opposing legislation that would allow larger trucks on New Jersey highways. It has sent to every member of the Legislature a copy of a nine-page brochure put out by the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, which is calling for lifting the 55-foot limit on overall truck length and favors allowing 60-foot tractor-semitrailers and 65-foot twin trailer combinations on the highways.
The brochure calls attention to the economic benefits of raising the limits to conform with those of contiguous states. However, the A.A.A. says that the use of such rigs would pose a danger to motorists on New Jersey's already congested highways.
ODDS & ENDS: Oral arguments are expected to begin this week in the appeal by former Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr., who was convicted of various charges stemming from the Abscam investigation. Mr.  Williams, who has appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals in Manhattan, resigned from the Senate last spring as it was considering moves for his ouster. He had been in the Senate for 23 years. … The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Newark will be the scene of a series of 16 concerts featuring music from around the world. The series will begin at 3:30 P.M. today with an organ recital by Richard Morris, a former parish priest who started his performing career at the age of 12 with the Atlanta Pops Orchestra … More than 200 cultural groups and historic organizations will take part in the exhibits, displays and performances at the Bergen County Arts Festival at Bergen County Community College in Paramus on Oct. 3. The shows will include ballet, bagpipes, orchestras and barbershop quartets … A citywide symposium on the impact of an elected Board of Education for Newark will be held at Essex County Community College in Newark on Oct. 23. Last May, the city's residents voted overwhelming to have an elected board rather than one appointed by the Mayor.

Immigration1.0-35030,NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,1982,11,new york times,By Albert J Parisi,section 11,1567.0,"EIGHT teen-agers from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida are attempting to do what no one has ever done before: Make a trip around the entire perimeter of New Jersey all under their own power.
The Jersey Journey, as it is called, was organized by Project U.S.E., a Long Branch-based group that provides wilderness experience for urban youths and others normally excluded from the challenges of the outdoors.
According to Phillip M. Costello, a Project U.S.E. founder, the teen-agers started on the first leg of the journey - a 70-mile hike along the Appalachian Trail - last Sunday. They are not expected to return to the starting point, the group's Wilderness Center on Wildcat Mountain in Passaic County, until Aug. 17.
From the Delaware Water Gap, where the first week's hike ends, the youngsters will take to canoes for a 185-mile voyage down the Delaware River, stopping at Penn's Landing in Philadelphia and making a one-day excursion to, and tour of, the nuclear-power generating station in Lower Alloways Creek, Salem County. The plant is owned by the Public Service Electric and Gas Company.
New Jersey Journal discusses several news stories from New Jersey
''The kids have a campsite right at the station, and they can practically canoe into the power plant,'' Mr. Costello said.  Continuing down Delaware Bay and around Cape May, the group will then travel up New Jersey's Atlantic coast, putting in some time sailing, canoeing, hiking and biking. The final leg of the journey will be a two-day bicycle trip back to Wildcat Mountain for work on Project U.S.E.'s new log building.
''This is New Jersey's version of a Mount Everest expedition,'' Mr. Costello said.  Aside from the challenge of doing something that has never been attempted before, Mr. Costello explained that the reason for the trip was to give the youngsters a ''real good look at the diverse environment of New Jersey and to focus on some of the current environmental problems in the state.''
''We also wanted to show them that they don't have to go to Wyoming to have an adventure,'' he added. ''They can have it right here.''
As of June 28, the terms of all seven state appointees to the 15-member Pinelands Commission had expired, leaving the commissioners in holdover positions until Governor Kean decides whether to reappoint or replace them. (Of the eight other commissioners, seven are county appointees and the last is named by the United States Secretary of the Interior.)
Some of the commissioners have been holdovers for as long as two years. Others, like Floyd V. West, the Mayor of Bass River Township, and Gary Patterson of Woodland Township, served three-year terms that expired last month.
Published articles in several newspapers have indicated that the Kean administration wants to replace Mr. West and Mr. Patterson, two of the strongest environmentalist voices on the panel. One other commissioner, Peter J. Burke of Williamstown, has asked not to be reappointed because business commitments have prevented him from attending many commission meetings.
The names most often mentioned as potential replacements are Steven Pollock, a planner for Ocean County; Elwood Jarmer, a planner for Cape May County, and Stephen Lee of Chatsworth, a berry grower.
Environmentalists have reacted vehemently to word of the replacements. As Carol Barrett, chairman of the West Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, put it:
''To lose Mr. West and Mr. Patterson is not only to lose the most knowledgeable and visible environmentalists on the commission, but it gives a sign that the Governor has said, 'O.K. boys, we won't support weakening pinelands protections through legislation, but we will support doing it administratively.' ''
Mr. West and Mr. Patterson have long been involved in pinelands issues. Mr. Patterson, who has fought to save the area for 13 years and served as vice chairman of the original Pinelands Review Committee, said that he would remain actively involved in pinelands issues even if he was not reappointed.
''The greatest solace I can take if three nonenvironmentallysensitive appointees are placed on the commission is that it will take them a while to undo the environmentally good work that Floyd and I have done,'' Mr. Patterson said.
Franklin E. Parker, the first and only chairman of the commission, has told Governor Kean that he wants to continue in that position, despite indications last year that he wanted to step down because commission members were placing too great a demand on his time as a corporate attorney in New York City.
''We haven't progressed as rapidly as I had wanted to on getting towns to conform to the management plan,'' Mr. Parker said. ''I want to be much more comfortable with that before I leave.''
Paul G. Wolcott, a spokesman for the Governor's office, said that an announcement on the appointments should come within a week.  ''There really has been no final decision so far,'' he said.  ''There have been rumors that two of the commissioners may be replaced. Well, they may be - but, then again, they may not be.''
The NJ Transit bus garage in Union City, which was partly destroyed by fire in May, still does not have a roof over Bay G, the last of seven bays in the busy Bergenline Avenue facility.
City officials said that NJ Transit, the state's mass-transit agency, had promised that it would hire a contractor and start repairs on the turn-of-the-century trolley barn-turned-bus garage within a short time of the fire. The officials were worried about the safety of the structure after the fire. Now, however, they have new concerns.
NJ Transit has announced plans to build a $25 million transportation center and garage in Secaucus. Despite that, Anthony L. Grazioso, a spokesman for NJ Transit, said that the agency was soliciting bids for repair work on the Union City facility.
''We're discussing plans to build a number of new garages around the state,'' Mr. Grazioso said. ''We have included the Secaucus facility in projections of our capital projects; if we get the money for it, we will build the new garage in the Meadowlands there. The fire at the Union City garage has moved up the project in our preliminary planning.''
Local officials in Union City were annoyed when they learned of NJ Transit's plan through a third party, not because it meant that the two-square-block garage in the city's commercial district would be abandoned, but because NJ Transit did not notify the city accordingly.
''When an agency has been married to a city that long, it would have been nice for somebody to call and say that we're thinking about moving,'' Robert C. Botti, Union City's Commissioner of Public Works, said.
According to Mr. Botti, the city now receives between $85,000 and $90,000 a year in lieu of taxes on the property.  ''I'm not concerned about NJ Transit moving out,'' Mr. Botti said, ''because I'm confident that we can develop the property to bring more dollars into the city.''
The area is zoned for commercial use, and Union City officials would like to see it developed into a large office complex. The approach to the Lincoln Tunnel is a block away.
If the skies over New Jersey had not cracked open with lateafternoon showers last Monday, all three New Jersey-based electric utilities would likely have set peak-load records that day.
After a weekend of scorching temperatures, people returned to sweltering offices and factories on Monday and, naturally, turned on the air-conditioners. That vast load, combined with an increased residential load, pushed demand up to an almost record-breaking pace throughout the day.
By mid-afternoon, officials of Public Service Electric and Gas, the state's largest utility, were projecting a new peak load for the system. Priscilla E. Suber, a spokesman for Public Service, said that the company anticipated sending out 7,250 megawatts between 5 and 6 P.M., which would have topped the previous record of 7,159 megawatts on July 21, 1980, when the temperature soared to a blistering 102 degrees.
However, the old record remains intact. Late-afternoon showers brought down the temperature and allowed some fans and airconditioners to be shut off. The highest demand for electricity came at 3 P.M., just before the showers. At that time, Public Service was sending out 7,035 megwatts of power.
According to Miss Suber, the utility had all of its generating stations operating, including both nuclear units, and easily met the demand.
The Jersey Central Power and Light Company also reached its peak load at about 3 P.M., when it sent out 2,894 megawatts. The utility's previous record, also set on July 21, 1980, was 3,024 megawatts.
New Jersey's third electric utility came closest to setting a record. Atlantic City Electric reported a peak demand of 1,254 megawatts at 6 P.M., just 10 megawatts lower than the record 1,264 megawatts that it sent out last July 9.

Immigration1.0-35030,NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,1982,11,new york times,By Albert J Parisi,section 11,1567.0,"THE Newark Boys Choir School, which for the last decade and a half has trained hundreds of youngsters for the internationally acclaimed Newark Boys Choir, will move next door to the city's Symphony Hall in the fall.
The move is expected to allow the school, which has had serious financial difficulties, to continue to provide many low-income, inner-city boys 9 to 13 years old with a comprehensive educational and cultural experience. The school is currently at 505 Orange Street.
''The business community really came through,'' said Robert J.  Edelman, general manager for planning and development of the Western Electric Company and president of the school's board of trustees, ''Now, instead of worrying about closing our doors, we can look forward to a much brighter future. We have improved our financial position substantially, and the move to Symphony Hall will create a center of culture right there on Broad Street.''
New Jersey Journal highlights news of importance to New Jersey residents
The school, which has an annual budget of about $280,000, was begun in 1969. Its financial woes last year were attributed to rising operating costs, a reduction in government aid for the arts and the faltering economic climate that evaporated some financial support.
The Newark Boys Chorus, which is composed of 26 of the moreadvanced youngsters at the school -the rest are in the training chorus - has won national and international acclaim. It recently presented a successful concert at Carnegie Hall, and in 1973, accompanied by the Italian Radio Symphony under Leonard Bernstein, it sang at the 10th anniversary celebration of Pope Paul. Last year, it won kudos on a three-week tour of Japan.
Concerts, which bring in about $60,000 a year, have been booked well in advance, with a fall tour of southern colleges coming up.  In addition to training in music theory and singing, the 53 boys in grades 5 to 8 get individual instruction in academic courses.  ''The individualized nature of the program allows the youngsters to push themselves to their limit,'' said Lawrence R. Emery, assistant academic director at the school, who also teaches science, history and English. ''The result is that many are two and three years ahead of their grade level in reading comprehension and math skills.  Private schools in the area want our youngsters.''
Because of the small number of students at the school, the per pupil cost is about $6,000. Tuition is $750 a year.
The isolation and academic pressure that may lead high school freshmen to drugs, alcohol or both are being countered in two Princeton schools by group interaction led by upper classmen.
At a conference next Saturday, the schools -Princeton Day School and Princeton High School -plan to demonstrate the skills needed for such a preventive program. The conference will be held at the Princeton Day School, and at least 100 students, teachers and counselors from schools in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut - some of which run programs similar to Princeton's peer adolescent groups - are expected to attend.
The Princeton programs, created and directed by Sharon Powell, offer freshmen a way to meet people and discuss problems with drugs, alcohol and relationships. Seniors trained in group dynamics lead the discussions and activities.
Peer group pressure is popular at both schools. At Princeton High, 180 of about 250 freshmen chose peer groups over a faculty adviser.  Many students said they joined to meet people. Beth Berman, a senior, said she learned that she was not alone in experiencing certain problems.
Ralph Heyman, a Princeton High teacher, said he had noticed a change in the school climate since the program began four years ago.  ''The social life is a little more fluid,'' he said. ''Students see they can have fun and activities where there's no alcohol.''
With an aim toward heading off the adoption of a bill that would require 5 percent deposits on all beverage containers, the New Jersey Food Council has begun a program designed to make consumers more aware of grocery items that come in boxes made of recycled newspapers.
More than 50 supermarkets, including some of the largest chains across the state, are pinpointing eggs, pasta, detergents, pet foods and other items that are packaged in recycled materials.
The move makes New Jersey the first state in the nation with a statewide packaging awareness program, according to Barbara W.  McConnell, executive director of the Food Council. She said that this was part of a nationwide consumer-education effort focusing on the benefits of using recycled packaging materials.
''This is the first time that an entire industry has participated in an effort of this kind,'' Mrs. McConnell said. ''All the major chains are involved.''
Mrs. McConnell, a former Democratic Assemblywoman from Flemington, said that, although only 50 stores were targeted for the initial phase of the drive, more than 90 percent of the approximately 1,050 supermarkets and grocery stores in the state carried items in recycled packages. Recycled paper is also used to make the bags in which groceries are carried home.
Mrs. McConnell noted that old newspapers and waste-paper products made up about 34 percent of all the waste materials dumped in landfills, many of which are nearing capacity. She said that New Jersey had a comprehensive recycling program, and that 286 of the 576 communities in the state had some form of newspaper- and glasscollection programs.
According to Mrs. McConnell, New Jersey has set a goal of recycling about 25 percent of all newspapers sold in the state and 50 percent of all glass.
''The food industry is committed to helping the state meet these goals,'' she said. ''Our aim is to make the state's system work effectively. The food industry is very much opposed to a bottle bill because it would only deal with beverage containers.
''Programs in other states that deal only with beverage containers are not working. Recycling is a comprehensive program, and is a better way of dealing with all wastes.''
Assemblyman Thomas H. Paterniti, Democrat of Metuchen, who has sponsored the bill requiring a 5-cent deposit on all glass, plastic and metal beverage containers, said that his proposal would deal effectively with one of the major problems in the state: litter and broken glass.
''I have been receiving a lot of calls from environmental groups supporting my bill,'' he said. ''It has been released from committee, but I don't know if it will come up for a vote this year. The Assembly Speaker (Alan J. Karcher, Democrat of Sayreville) said he wants to see a report on how the state's recycling law is working.''
Assemblyman Paterniti, who is also a dentist, said that his proposal did away with many of the complaints from union groups that requiring deposits would eliminate jobs. The bottles, cans and plastic containers would be crushed and not be reusable, and the materials would then be recycled.
''No particular industry would be adversely affected,'' Mr.  Paterniti said. ''The plan would generate extra money for the state and could even create jobs.''
Starting tomorrow, Amtrak riders headed for Washington will be able to board express Metroliners at Pennsylvania Station in Newark.  The Newark stop, according to Amtrak officials, will save passengers 15 minutes and 50 cents from the normal $45 New York-to-Washington fare.
The express, at 2 hours 49 minutes Amtrak's fastest rail link to the nation's capital from New York, was introduced two years ago with limited stops along the way, said Diane Elliott, an Amtrak spokeswoman.
''Originally, the New York-to-Washington run stopped only in Philadelphia and Baltimore,'' she said. ''Because of rider requests, we added Wilmington, Del., last year.''
Similar requests and complaints, Miss Elliott added, prompted Amtrak officials to study the Newark stop, particularly because of the city's easy access to Wall Street.
''It's much easier for people from the financial district to take a PATH train to Newark and catch the express there than get the same train out of Penn Station in New York,'' she said.
ODDS & ENDS: Perth Amboy High School will hold a Decathlon of Knowledge next Saturday, a series of events that will pit 10-member teams from the 20 high schools in Middlesex County in tests of knowledge and intellectual skills. … Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark has urged President Reagan to unconditionally pardon Frank Wills, a former security guard at the Watergate complex in Washington, who was arrested and sentenced to a year in jail for stealing a $12 pair of sneakers for his son. Mr. Wills was instrumental in discovering a burglary being committed at the Democratic Party's headquarters at Watergate, the incident that eventually led to President Richard M. Nixon's resignation.

Immigration1.0-35030,NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,1982,11,new york times,By Albert J Parisi,section 11,1567.0,"ton, six-story structure that draws 25,000 tourists to Margate each summer, is wearing thin and is about to be reconditioned, thanks to a local preservation group.
''There's a whole lot of work to be done, both on the outside and in,'' said Josephine Harron, head of the Save Lucy Committee, a nonprofit group of 30 volunteers. The state is providing loans of $4,000 for exterior work and $48,000 for interior renovations.
Since its formation in 1973, the committee has raised $360,000 to keep Lucy in shape, Mrs. Harron said. ''Lucy's a one-of-a-kind,'' she added, explaining that among the attraction's many honors was a ''landmark'' designation bestowed by the National Historic Society.
New Jersey Journal column highlights efforts to save Margate landmark, Newark Public Library and New Jersey Senatorial campaign
Built in 1881 by a local land developer who wanted to emphasize the ''wilds'' of undeveloped terrain, the structure served as a realestate office. In 1970, Lucy was donated to the city of Margate and moved to a public beach area three blocks south, thus giving her greater visibility. The transfer cost $9,000.
''We couldn't see Lucy being torn down back then to make way for a new high-rise,'' Mrs. Harron said. ''She is just too unique to have had such an end.''
Lucy's design plans are patented and still on file in Washington.  When the renovations are completed, she will serve as a small museum of seashore history.
''We're hoping for additional interest and funds from the county,'' said Mrs. Harron, explaining that Atlantic County Freeholders have been verbally but not financially supportive of Lucy in the past.
The Newark Public Library has cut its staff by one-third because of reductions in state aid. According to Anthony Vacca, a spokesman for the library, 89 of 271 librarians, custodians, pages and administrative staff members were let go. Also, 31 current employees will be demoted in a move designed to eliminate raises.
''In addition to that, we lost 10 people over the summer through attrition, and they will not be replaced,'' Mr. Vacca said.  Hours at the main library on Washington Street will not be affected, but library administrators plan to reduce them - some by as much as 50 percent -at 10 branches throughout the city, as well as at two community libraries based in the Dayton Street and Mount Vernon elementary schools. They also plan to close the music and education departments in the evening and curtail, from three days a week to one, access to the New Jersey reference section.
Mr. Vacca said that this year's state aid, totaling $661,000, was a reduction of 19.6 percent from last year's $822,000.  Library administrators also hope to curb some spending by introducing a security system designed to prevent book thefts in an inventory that boasts 1.2 million volumes. However, the system will not be in operation for some time.
Although the Newark City Council has increased its aid to the library by as much as 50 percent in recent years - the total budget for 1982 is $4,264,000 -state aid is expected to continue to drop.
''The city has pretty much held up its end,'' Mr. Vacca said.  ''However, with Reaganomics and the recession, it looks very bleak for the next year.''
Library administrators have been seeking donations from businessmen but say that funds have not surfaced because there is no corporate representation on the institution's Board of Trustees. Board members are appointed by Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson.
''I suppose that business people in the community feel that, if they are going to donate money to the system, they should have a say in how the money is spent,'' Mr. Vacca said.
The New Jersey State Safety Council reports that the number of traffic fatalities in the state's 21 counties has dropped by 14.5 percent - from 792 in the year ending Sept. 5, 1981, to 677 through the same 1982 date.
The decline, said William C. Peto, director of the council's Traffic Division, is a result of the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit and increasing safety awareness among drivers.
Addressing a recent meeting of the Bergen County Traffic Safety Committee, Mr. Peto said that most fatal accidents were caused by drunken drivers. One way to help reduce the fatality rate, he said, would be a legislative agreement between New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania to raise the minimum drinking age to 21. The drinking age is now 19 in New York and New Jersey and 21 in Pennsylvania.
''With this type of mutual legislation,'' Mr. Peto said, ''the number of accidents in which lives are wasted will drop drastically because it will deter people from crossing state lines to purchase liquor.''
He stressed that a high percentage of drivers involved in fatal accidents were 16 to 24 years old.  According to the council, of the 677 fatalities reported in the 12-month period ended Sept. 5, a total of 246 occured in 225 accidents on state highways, 275 in 149 accidents on county roads and 105 in 94 accidents on municipal streets.
The Trojans, a team of eight paratroopers from Fort Devens, Mass., are scheduled to drop into Palmer Stadium Saturday during half-time of Princeton-Army football game, The contest marks the first time since 1940 that Princeton will be playing Army at home.
Alexander M. Haig Jr., the former Secretary of State, who has been lecturing at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Adminstration, is expected to be in the stands. So is Gen. John R. Guthrie (ret.), a member of the Princeton Class of 1942, whose son, Kevin, is an end on the Princeton team, and Lieut. Gen. Willard W. Scott Jr., superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point.
The state board of the New Jersey chapter of the National Organization for Women, representing 9,000 members, has voted to support Frank Lautenberg, the Democratic candidate for United States Senator.
''We regret that we cannot support Millicent Fenwick,'' said Christine Carmody-Arey, NOW's New Jersey coordinator. ''I am an affirmative action person, and I want to see more women in the House and Senate. But we insist on qualified people who have a record that we can support. Unfortunately, Millicent Fenwick fails to meet our criteria.''
According to NOW, Mrs. Fenwick voted to support President Reagan's economic policies 64 percent of the time.  ''Millicent Fenwick is a proven supporter of E.R.A.,'' said Mrs.  Carmody-Arey, ''but she votes against economic programs designed to benefit women, particularly working women and their families. She voted to cut back on day care, Medicare, housing, food stamps, nutrition programs and job training for women entering the work force. She also voted against a guaranteed minimum of $122 a month in Social Security benefits.''
Assemblywoman Angela L. Perun, Democrat of Plainfield, agreed.  ''Fenwick voted for budget cuts which result in the impoverization of females and children,'' she said. ''Much of our families are single-parent families with women at the head. It is the mother who is getting kicked in the teeth.''
''The bottom line is economics,'' Mrs. Carmody-Arey said. ''When Fenwick says that she supports women's issues, and then votes for the closing of five of the nine New Jersey day-care centers, votes to eliminate 90,000 New Jersey children from school lunch programs and votes to reduce Medicaid benefits and nutrition programs for the elderly, then she is talking out of both sides of her mouth. My Irish mother calls that 'blarney.' ''
''She is a nice person,'' said Nancy Stultz, staff member of the New Jersey NOW office. ''But we need someone who is going to help us. We cannot afford Millicent Fenwick.''
Senator Gary Hart, Democrat of Colorado and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will speak on ''The Future of Arms Control'' at the third annual Teaching Conference on Nuclear Disarmament at the Nassau Presbyterian Church in Princeton Saturday and next Sunday.
The conference is sponsored by the 700-member Coalition for Nuclear Disarmament, coordinated by the Rev. Robert Moore, a United Church of Christ minister. The coalition, which includes 21 Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish organizations, seeks to foster alternative systems of national security and promote peace by political action and education.
Other scheduled speakers at the conference are Joseph Lowery, president of the United Christian Leadership Conference; Marian Wright Edelman, president of the Children's Defense Fund, Washington; William W. Winpinsinger, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; Inga Thorson, Swedish Under Secretary of State; Mark Garrison, director of the Center for Foreign Policy Development, Providence, R.I., and Herbert Scoville Jr., president of the Arms Control Association, Washington.
Workshops will be held on such topics as nuclear ''numbing,'' lobbying skills and the medical implications of nuclear weapons.  There also will be plays, readings and dances by local artists. An interfaith worship service will be held Sunday in the Princeton University Chapel.

Immigration1.0-35030,NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,1982,11,new york times,By Albert J Parisi,section 11,1567.0,"A raid by Federal agents on a Passaic clothing factory earlier this month may force the deportation of 40 illegal Polish aliens, all of them women who worked as sewing-machine operators. The raid, which was conducted by 50 agents of the Internal Revenue and Immigration and Naturalization Services, centered on Fashion Associates Inc.
The company's financial records were also seized under warrants issued by United States Magistrate G. Donald Haneke in Newark for what officials are calling probable violations of Federal income tax, labor and immigration laws.
Of the 52 persons arrested, all but one were released within hours of being interviewed at the Immigration Service office in Newark.  ''One woman, a Filipino national, is still being held,'' said Diane Armenakis, an assistant United States Attorney. The 40 women, she said, are considered illegal aliens and face deportation proceedings, but no criminal charges. However, because of political unrest in Poland, officials stress that deportation is unlikely.
New Jersey Journal highlights illegal aliens in Passaic, hospital course on how to cope in a medical emergency and drop in burglaries in Morris County
''From what I understand, for these women to remain in the country legally, they must be classified as 'political exiles' by the State Department in Washington,'' Mrs. Armenakis said. ''That's where the issue stands right now.''
The women are believed to live in the Wallington and Passaic areas, which have large Polish-American communities.  Mass arrests of illegal aliens in New Jersey are not unusual. In April, several hundred Colombian and Salvadoran nationals were seized in one week throughout the state and eventually deported.
A special program originating from Overlook Hospital in Summit is getting across the message that keeping calm and avoiding panic are just as important in saving lives as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, as it is commonly known.
''Emergency: The First Five Minutes!'' is a two-hour course taught by certified members of the hospital's CPR Unit on how to cope and what to do in a medical emergency. The program has just been completed by 150 employees of Bloomingdale's at the Short Hills Mall, and additional classes are expected to resume after the holidays.
''There's such a helpless feeling in people who witness someone who collapses,'' said Connie Anderson, the hospital's CPR coordinator, adding that training focuses on what to do in the interim. ''For the most part, when there's an accident or someone is stricken, there isn't a doctor in the house.''
Mrs. Anderson said that immediate help could be offered by trained co-workers or employees. Action in those few minutes between the time someone is hurt and an emergency medical unit arrives can often save lives.
''Mainly, we're teaching people to keep their heads and call for immediate assistance,'' Mrs. Anderson said. ''A medical unit that's properly informed on the situation by a caller who calmly describes the emergency has a better chance to do its job.''
The program, which took a year to plan and organize, is serving businesses and industry in parts of Union, Morris, Essex and Somerset Counties. Hospital officials contend that demand for the training will increase once the course is better known.
''The employees in Bloomingdale's were enthusiastic over the course and quick to pick up on it,'' Mrs. Anderson said.  The course costs $40 per instructor for each 10 students.
Dr. William Pecoraro of Demarest has won a legal battle, and its effect is not so much on his wallet as on his eardrums. For the last 12 years, Dr. Pecoraro, a dentist, has objected to a high-pitch fire siren that is bolted to a utility pole just outside his home and office on Hardenburgh Avenue.
His pleas to local officials for its removal, Dr. Pecoraro contends, have fallen on deaf ears. But the State Superior Court has ruled that the siren is a public nuisance and has asked the Demarest Mayor and Council to seek a solution.
The siren, like its counterpart across town, is the only practical way to alert the volunteer firefighters, emergency officials say.  They will not remove the sirens, but have curtailed a testing schedule and lowered the sound level.
''The problem is that the siren goes off at all hours of the night - and not just in emergencies,'' Dr. Pecoraro said, adding that residents in 180 towns throughout the state have similar problems.  Local and state health officials have documented that the siren, which blares for nearly three minutes, exceeds Federal standards in terms of noise level.
''Sometimes, it goes off a few times in the middle of the night, and sometimes in the day, when I'm working on a patient,'' Dr.  Pecoraro said. ''You learn to make do.''
If town officials continue dragging their heels over the issue, Dr. Pecoraro said, he and several neighbors will continue legal action.  ''This is more than a little peace of mind for me,'' he said. ''I'm trying to protect my family and our hearing.''
Of the nearly 10,000 vehicles pulled over and examined in October by roving inspection teams of the state's Division of Motor Vehicles, more than half failed because of one or more safety defects.
Clifford W. Snedeker, the division's director, said that the drivers of 31 percent of those vehicles were given tickets for extremely serious safety violations. The tickets were written by local police officers aiding the inspection teams.
Also, 165 cars were impounded because they were ''too unsafe for continued highway operation,'' were unregistered or were being driven by motorists with suspended licenses.
Since September, when the roadside spot inspections began, nearly 15,000 private and commercial vehicles have been stopped. The inspections are limited to off-peak hours so as not to cause motorists delays in their work schedules.
The average inspection is said to take about five minutes.
Psyching out the opponent is the name of the game these days for Dr. Selwyn Mirkin, a Teaneck psychologist with a doctorate in human relations. He treats athletes, mostly tennis players and the like, who have a problem in common: They can't win.
Dr. Mirkin described his technique, which he calls ''See-Feel-Win,'' this way: ''I determine if the person is susceptible to being put in a trance state first. If he is, I hypnotize him and let him regress to a time in a previous match when he felt comfortable and played well.
''Then we run through a match that may be upcoming and which he's nervous about. I have him imagine making excellent strokes and trouncing his opponent. Actually, I'm desensitizing my client to think positive.''
The patient, he said, must meet two criteria if treatment is to be worthwhile: He must have had successful experiences in the past and he must be susceptible to hypnosis.
Dr. Mirkin said that he could, for example, bring an ex-Ping Pong player who had not competed in 10 years up to 80 percent of his former capacity.
One of the psychologist's patients is 12-year-old Henry Mandeville of Montvale, who is ranked 15th in his division by the Eastern Tennis Association. Henry has been undergoing treatment for five weeks.
''It's unbelievable,'' his mother said. ''Henry played a 17-yearold top Bergen County teen-ager -I mean he shaves already - and he made a good showing. Last weekend, a kid who Henry had never beaten before just folded under my son.''
A 94 percent increase in burglaries in Morris County between 1975 and 1980 prompted County Prosecutor investigators there to come up with an educational crime-prevention program and resource center financed by a $36,000 Federal grant.
Since January 1981, more than 125 municipal police personnel and thousands of citizens have cooperated to reduce residential and commercial burglaries, which went from 3,315 in 1981 to 2,202 in the first eight months of this year, a decrease of 33.6 percent.
The Society of Crime Prevention Practictioners - a national organization of law-enforcement professionals - sent its president, Brooks Russell of Seattle, to Morristown earlier this month to give the county the society's Outstanding Unit award for ''contributions, accomplishments and achievements in this exciting new field of public safety.''
John T. Dempsey, Morris County's crime-prevention coordinator, attributed much of the success to citizens trained by the police in neighborhood seminars. He noted that 60 percent of the burglaries occurred in the daytime, and that residents' new awareness and new precautions had helped neighborhoods to make themselves less vulnerable to intruders.
''Municipal Police Departments with manpower shortages were willing to risk taking a man off patrol duty to institute crimeprevention programs, and now they can see the benefits,'' Mr.  Dempsey said. ''Citizens in 38 municipalities have become the eyes and ears of the police to direct them to places where crimes may be about to occur.''

A major immigration bill was passed in the Senate by a vote of 76 to 18. The comprehensive measure would outlaw the hiring of illegal aliens and authorize an amnesty for more than one million illegal aliens already in this country. The bill now goes to the House, where a similar measure is awaiting a floor vote. The Reagan Administration generally supports the legislation. (A1:6.)
A proposed Federal budget with large deficits and only minor tax increases was approved by Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee and sent to the Senate floor. The unexpected action signaled a second attempt by the Republican majority leader, Howard H. Baker Jr., to muster enough votes for a budget acceptable to President Reagan. The Senate defeated a similar plan last week. (A1:4-5.)

Immigration1.0-35315,"NEXT MOVE ON A POSSIBLE DEFECTOR IS UP TO WASHINGTON, OFFICIALS SAY",1983,11,new york times,,section a,426.0,"A State Department official here said today that a Chinese diplomatic courier had asked for asylum, but the Immigration and Naturalization Service would not confirm that such a request had been made, and officials here said that officials in Washington must make the next move in the case.
The courier, Gogiang Yang, remained in Chicago under the joint authority of the service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Mr. Yang was aboard a Pan Am flight from San Francisco to New York when it made an unscheduled stop Friday at O'Hare Airport in Chicago and he left the plane. He had had an in-flight dispute with a fellow courier, airline officials and passengers said, and he gave a diplomatic pouch handcuffed to his wrist to the other courier before being taken into custody by F.B.I. and I.N.S. officials.
State Department official says Chinese diplomatic courier asked for asylum, but Immigration and Naturalization Service refuses to confirm this; courier, Gogiang Yang, remains in Chicago under joint authority of service and FBI (M)
Today, Peter Galuppo, the special agent in charge of the State Department's office of security here, said Mr. Yang had asked for asylum, but he could not confirm that the necessary papers had been signed.

'Totally Confidential'
However, A. D. Moyer, the district director of the immigration service here, would not say that Mr. Yang had made an official request to remain in the United States.
''Asylum requests are such that the nature of them are totally confidential unless the party requesting asylum chooses to go before the public,'' said Mr. Moyer, whose agency is responsible for making decisions on requests for asylum.
The courier is still classified by the State Department as a diplomatic official accredited by a foreign government, Mr. Moyer said, and until that classification is changed, ''I am not going to interfere.''
Mr. Galuppo, the local State Department official, said, ''It is now being taken care of at the White House, which is considering the case, and the Chinese Embassy will be involved.''

Further Consideration Expected
''There will be a lot of political in- house things going on from this point,'' Mr. Galuppo said. ''There'll be a couple of days of settling down. My experience in the past is that this is not a quick type of thing.''
The chief F.B.I. agent here, Edward D. Hegarty, would say only that the bureau ''has been interviewing Gogiang Yang, People's Republic of China courier, since Friday, Nov. 25, 1983, which is within the jurisdictional purview of this agency. No additional comment is being made at this time.''
Decisions on asylum are made by the immigration service, but that agency generally seeks and follows the advice of the State Department.

Prof. Martin Kilson's Feb. 9 letter charging Nigeria with ''moral myopia'' in the expulsion from Nigeria of illegal immigrants and your editorial condemnation of Nigeria to which he referred both reveal an inability to make moral distinctions.
How can one compare a system whose laws deny all freedom of movement to the vast majority of citizens (South Africa) or one which tortures political prisoners (Zaire) or one which aggressively advances religious fanaticism (Libya) with the legal expulsion of foreigners who came into the country on 90-day visits and long overstayed? We in Africa do not live in the best of all possible worlds, any more than Americans faced with illegal Mexican, Haitian and Cuban immigration do.
As a former Nigerian Foreign Minister and, like Kilson, a black intellectual, I do not hesitate to make moral judgments where appropriate, whatever the offenders' race, but I must protest when emotions interfere with reasoned analysis.

Immigration1.0-35198,OVERHAUL OF IMMIGRATION LAW GAINS IN SENATE,1982,5,new york times,AP,section 1,588.0,"The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a bill to overhaul the nation's immigration law in a major step toward resolving a long-term dispute.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, was the lone dissenter Thursday as the panel voted, 16 to 1, to send the proposal to the Senate.
Just minutes before the final vote, Mr. Kennedy won a concession that would greatly increase the number of illegal aliens now in the country who would be eligible for legal status.
WASHINGTON, May 28 (AP) - The Senate Judiciary Committee has approved a bill to overhaul the nation's immigration law in a major step toward resolving a long-term dispute.
The Republican-controlled committee, by an 8-to-7 vote, approved Mr. Kennedy's proposal to give temporary legal status to illegal aliens who could prove they had been here since Jan. 1.
Another version had set the date at Jan. 1, 1980, the same as in a similar immigration bill pending before the House Judiciary Committee.
The difference of two years could mean legal status for five million illegal immigrants, or 500,000 more aliens than would otherwise be eligible, according to Reagan Administration and committee figures. It is estimated that there are six million illegal aliens in the United States.
Temporary legal status would be the first step for an illegal alien to gain citizenship. However, some illegal aliens say they are fearful of stepping forward and acknowledging their illegal status.
Administration officials said that if Congress agreed on the 1982 date, President Reagan would probably accept it. The Administration had recommended Jan. 1, 1981, as the cut-off date.
The bill also proposed permanent legal residence for any immigrant here before Jan. 1, 1978.

Penalties Against Employers
The measure would also impose the first civil and criminal penalties against employers who knowingly hired immigrants who lacked legal status.
Mr. Kennedy objected to that provision. He said he was worried that employers, out of fear of being fined and sentenced to jail, would automatically reject job applications from people of Hispanic descent.
Mr. Kennedy had unsuccessfully proposed that such sanctions against employers be automatically canceled after two years unless the President could certify that they were not being used to discriminate against members of minority groups.
In recent years attempts to change the immigration law have stalled in Congress as proposals got caught between opposition from many sides. Hispanic groups, among others, favored eased restrictions on immigrants, while opponents pushed for stricter measures to guard the nation's borders.
The committee vote on Thursday suggested that Congress might be ready after years of stalemate to overhaul the immigration laws.  Bipartisan praise was showered on Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, the sponsor of the measure, for working out a painstaking compromise. The House version, which is close to the Simpson bill but not exactly the same, is sponsored by Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky.
Both measures contain the proposed sanctions against employers. An employer would be required to check a job applicant's eligibility by asking him to show either a birth certificate or passport and a Social Security card or driver's license.
The legislation envisions that after three years the Government would develop a means of checking legal status, through an identification card or through a computerized data bank.

''I was working in a plant here. I was paid very little for a lot of work.'' In June the plant laid him off and he began considering seeking work on the other side.
Border Patrol reports increase in number of Mexicans illegally entering US
''The devaluation made up my mind,'' he said. ''I went over on a Sunday, got a job on Monday.''

Rise in Arrests
Officials of the Border Patrol, a law-enforcement arm of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, say more Mexicans are attempting entry in the El Paso region, which stretches 180 miles along Texas and New Mexico west to the Arizona state line. Alan E.  Eliason, chief patrol agent for the district, estimated that the total of arrests of undocumented aliens for August would show ''a 25 percent to 30 percent increase'' over the same month last year, when 12,430 were arrested.
Border officials say they believe the reasons for the increase are the Mexican Treasury's Aug. 5 devaluation of the peso, which has fallen in value from 49 to the American dollar to 126, and the start of the harvest season, when seasonal workers, many of them in the United States illegally, are used by American agricultural businesses to bring in the cotton, fruit and vegetable crops.
''We think the largest percent of the increase is due to the peso devaluation, because July was rather comparable to last year,'' Mr.  Eliason said.
Local Mexican-American groups and others suggested that the rising number of arrests also reflected a crackdown intended to put pressure on Congress as it considers tough new immigration legislation.

Some Cross Daily
Mr. Eliason said he supported the legislation, now at a critical stage of consideration by Congress, but he called suggestions that the increased arrests were politically motivated ''absolutely ridiculous.''
''We are faced with increased illegal entries, we tried to put more people on the line to apprehend illegal entries, and we arrested a larger number than usual because there are increased illegal entries,'' he said.
Last week the El Paso district reported that on Aug. 24 it broke a one-day record by arresting 1,205 Mexicans for illegal entry into the United States. The average number of daily arrests for the month of August so far is 452, in contrast to 401 in August last year.
''As long as there's that lure, jobs, we're not going to be able to do anything about it,'' Mr. Eliason said.

Urges Tougher Legislation
State Representative Paul C. Moreno, an El Paso Democrat who is chairman of the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus in the Texas House of Representatives, said he believed the Border Patrol's announcement of record arrests was timed to aid the measure.
''That's the way politics is done, the way bills are passed,'' Mr.  Moreno said. ''I have no doubt that's the reason.'' ''We've had the Border Patrol for years,'' said Joe Loya, director for El Paso of the League of United Latin American Citizens. ''Why, all of a sudden, are they being so effective?''

Supported by Administration
The immigration measure is sponsored by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky. It would, among other things, require employers to seek proof of citizenship or legal alien status from all prospective workers, and by extension would require job applicants to have such proof available.
Critics of the legislation assert that it would discriminate against Americans of Hispanic descent because, in practice, they say, only Hispanic people would be asked for proof.
The measure, which is strongly backed by the Reagan Administration, also calls for fines of as much as $2,000 and jail terms for employers who regularly employ illegal workers. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider it on Sept. 14.
Mexican-American leaders such as Mr. Loya said that the legislation, if passed, would not stem the flow of undocumented aliens from Mexico because economic conditions here were so bad.
Mr. Castro, who has a wife and a daughter, said he now pays 15 pesos for a kilo of tortillas that cost 7 before the devaluation this month. He said the American dollars he brings home help him to cope with the higher prices.

Blending Into the Streets
But even on that point there is disagreement. Another man, Jose Luis Hernandez, said he had ''to pay in dollars in Juarez already,'' eliminating any advantage. As he spoke, Mr. Hernandez had already reached the American side of the river and was waiting to blend with the people on El Paso's streets.
Unlike Mr. Castro, Mr. Hernandez has long made a practice of slipping past border patrols to work in El Paso. So has Olga Martinez Robles, an 18-year-old from the interior of Chihuahua State who waited in a group with Mr. Hernandez. She said she has done housework in El Paso homes since the age of 12. ''They pay me the same'' as before devaluation, she said, ''but it's worth a little more.''
Mr. Hernandez said that for four years he has done plumbing work in the United States, for $4.50 an hour, cash.  ''Clearly in Mexico,'' he said, ''1,000 pesos is worth nothing.''

Immigration1.0-35121,SENATE COMPLETES DEBATE ON ALIENS MEASURE,1982,8,new york times,"By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times",section 1,863.0,"The Senate today completed debate on a bill granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens and establishing criminal penalties for employers who make a practice of hiring illegal aliens.
A final vote on passage of the bill is scheduled for Tuesday. Both supporters and opponents of the measure say it is likely to win approval from the Senate. A similar measure is pending before the House Judiciary Committee, where its prospects are uncertain.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 - The Senate today completed debate on a bill granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens and establishing criminal penalties for employers who make a practice of hiring illegal aliens.
The Reagan Administration generally supports the bill, having proposed similar legislation last year.  The Senate debated more than a dozen amendments today, but refused to make any substantial change in the basic bill, sponsored by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming.

Opposed by Hispanic Groups
Hispanic groups bitterly criticized the proposed amnesty program, saying it was so restrictive that few illegal aliens would come forward to take advantage of it.
The program would grant permanent resident status to illegal aliens who entered the United States before Jan. 1, 1977, and have resided here continuously since then. It would grant ''temporary resident'' status to those who entered the country from Jan. 1, 1977, to Jan. 1, 1980. Temporary residents, after three years in that status, could become permanent residents. Aliens, in turn, after five years as permanent residents, could apply for citizenship.
Antonia Hernandez of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund said in an interview that the amnesty program ''legalized exploitation'' and predicted that ''no one will come forward'' to participate in it.
In a statement released by her organization, Miss Hernandez said: ''The Senate ignored the concerns of the Hispanic community in this bill. The legalization program requires that newly legalized aliens continue to pay Federal taxes without receiving benefits for three years or six years. This is known as taxation without representation.''

Ineligible for U.S. Aid
During their three years as temporary residents and during their first three years as permanent residents, aliens would be ineligible to receive welfare, food stamps, Medicaid and other forms of Federal assistance.
The Senate also authorized an unspecified amount of Federal aid for state and local governments that incur additional expenses as a result of the influx of illegal aliens.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who proposed the grants to state and local governments, estimated that they would cost $5.5 billion over the next seven years.
Miss Hernandez said that under the proposed amnesty program, illegal aliens who came to the United States after Jan. 1, 1980, would ''continue to live in the same underclass this bill was designed to eradicate.''

Legalization Plan Defended
Senator Grassley estimated that a million illegal aliens had entered this country in the last two years, and said he did not want to legalize their presence here because they had not built up the same ''equities'' as other aliens who had lived here longer.
Senator Simpson defended the legalization procedure, saying that the resources of the Immigration and Naturalization Service were better spent in trying to prevent illegal entries than in trying to locate illegal aliens who had already settled here.
The Simpson bill makes alien workers more readily available to farmers and growers of various fruit and vegetable crops. By a vote of 62 to 28, the Senate today rejected an amendment offered by Senator Edward M. Kennedy that would have required the Government to retain all the existing rules for the temporary worker program.
The Massachusetts Democrat said that it was inappropriate to relax the rules for alien workers at a time of high unemployment in the United States. Under the Simpson bill, Mr. Kennedy said, ''a grower can turn down a U.S. citizen seeking more than the minimum wage,'' and instead hire an alien at the minimum wage.
The Senate rejected, by a vote of 69 to 22, another Kennedy amendment that would have ended the ''employer sanctions'' program after three years if it led to discrimination against Hispanic Americans or other members of minority groups. The amendment would have required the President to certify that the program was not being used in a discriminatory manner.
Under the program, employers must ask all job applicants to demonstrate that they are either citizens or aliens authorized to work in the United States. Employers who knowingly hired illegal aliens would be subject to penalties of $1,000 for each illegal alien on the first offense and $2,000 for each alien on subsequent violations. A ''pattern or practice'' of hiring illegal aliens would be a crime, and upon conviction, an employer could be sentenced to six months in prison and required to pay an additional fine of $1,000.

Immigration1.0-35442,SENATE PANEL BACKS REVISIONS IN IMMIGRATION LAW,1983,4,new york times,By ROBERT PEAR,section a,656.0,"The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved a bill that would revise the nation's immigration laws by establishing penalties for employing illegal aliens and by offering amnesty to more than a million illegal aliens already in the United States.
By a vote of 13 to 4, the committee recommended passage of the bill by the full Senate, which is expected to take up the legislation later this month or next month.
The bill, sponsored by Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, is similar to one passed by the full Senate last year, 80 to 19.  But that bill died in the House, which was unable to complete action before adjournment. However, this Congress is acting much more swiftly on the legislation than the last Congress did.
WASHINGTON, April 19 - The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved a bill that would revise the nation's immigration laws by establishing penalties for employing illegal aliens and by offering amnesty to more than a million illegal aliens already in the United States.
Under the Simpson bill, an employer who hired illegal aliens would be subject to a fine of $1,000 for each alien involved in the first offense and $2,000 for each alien in the second offense. An employer found to have engaged in a ''pattern or practice'' of such hiring could be fined up to $1,000 and imprisoned for up to six months.

Kennedy Amendments Rejected
Before approving the measure today, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected a series of amendments that would have made the bill more palatable to Hispanic Americans and civil liberties advocates.
The amendments would have liberalized the amnesty for illegal aliens, preserved additional levels of judicial review in immigration cases and ended the ''employer sanctions'' after five years if there proved to be a pattern of discrimination against United States citizens who were members of a particular ethnic group. The amendments were all offered by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.
The Simpson bill offers legal status to aliens who have ''resided continuously in the United States in an unlawful status'' since Jan.  1, 1980. Senator Kennedy, using statistics supplied by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said this section of the bill might provide legal status to 1.8 million of the estimated six million illegal aliens.
The committee rejected Mr. Kennedy's proposal to change the eligibility date to Dec. 31, 1981. Under this proposal, he said, a total of 3.6 million illegal aliens might have qualified.
Sixteen months after the last Congress convened, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a comprehensive immigration bill. But the pace is much faster this year, with today's action coming only three and a half months after the start of the current Congress.

House Panel Acted Earlier
On April 6, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration approved an immigration bill sponsored by Representative Romano L.  Mazzoli, Democrat of Kentucky. Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said today, ''The full House Judiciary Committee will take up the immigration bill some time in May.''
Mr. Rodino said that he would not wait for action by the full Senate as he did last year.  There are several differences between the Simpson and Mazzoli bills. But supporters of the legislation said they were sure they could iron out differences if the two houses passed generally similar bills.
John Shattuck of the American Civil Liberties Union said: ''The committee's action today is a serious blow to the right of political asylum.'' We will make all efforts to change the bill on the Senate floor.'' Mr. Shattuck said his group was ''also very concerned about the discriminatory potential of employer sanctions.''
Antonia Hernandez of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund said the latest version of Mr. Simpson's bill was ''just as objectionable'' as the one passed by the Senate last year.  ''It does not represent the interests of the Hispanic community, which is just as much a part of this society as business, labor and agricultural growers, whose concerns are reflected in the bill,'' she said.

Immigration1.0-35435,SOCIETY MAKES NO-INTEREST LOANS TO NEW YORK'S IMMIGRANTS,1983,5,new york times,,section 1,678.0,"On a December evening in 1892, 11 men met at the Wilner Synagogue on Henry Street in Manhattan and pooled their savings - $95 - to establish a free loan society similar to those they had known in their native eastern European countries.
''They would lend out $5 to the next guy off the boat so he could load up a pushcart, make a few dollars to feed his family and slowly pay back the loan,'' said Nathan Belth, executive director of the Hebrew Free Loan Society. The loans were interest free, as the Old Testament prescribes.
The first year the society lent $1,205 in amounts of $5 and $10. By 1905, some 15,000 families, mostly Jewish immigrants living on the Lower East Side, had borrowed $364,480.
Hebrew Free Loan Society, founded in 1892, continues to make no-interest loans to New York's immigrantsLoans of $2 Million a Year
Today the society is still making interest-free loans to immigrants, giving out $2 million each year since 1976. Although the society still lends the majority of its money to Jews, it has been a nonsectarian organization since its founding.
The maximum loan of $750 is given to about 2,500 people each year.  ''Often the loan is for an elderly person whose Social Security check is late or when a family has a sudden crisis like a large medical expense or a business problem,'' Mr. Belth said. ''We don't ask the reason but by the time they leave, we know what it is. The story just pours out. People feel they have to justify their request.
''One woman needed to make the last installment on her daughter's cello. A first-rate one costs $10,000. We've helped a number of musicians.''
The loans must be repaid in 10 months, 10 percent each month. They require a guarantee by a credit-worthy endorser.  On the 75th anniversary of the society in 1967, it reported that it had made loans totaling more than $52 million to more than 776,500 people. Since then the society has lent more than an additional $30 million.
Mr. Belth said that the rate of repayment was high. The society figures, he said, that last year all but $100 in loans were repaid, and those who did not pay them back were probably older people who had died.
Among the donors who had helped finance the efforts of the society was Jacob H. Schiff, a banker, who contributed $100 a few months after the society was formed. In 1896, Mr. Schiff sent his second contribution, $1,000. For the next four years, he contributed $5,000 annually. During his lifetime and that of his son, Mortimer, the Schiffs contributed well over $100,000.
Baron Maurice and Baroness Clara de Hirsch, neither of whom had ever been to the United States, donated $6,000 to the society in 1897. The deHirsches had been organizers of free-loan societies in London, Paris, Cracow, Bucharest and other European cities. In addition, Mr. Belth said, over the years the society has received both small and substantial contributions from those to whom it had made loans.

Referred by Organizations
Few people walk in off the street to the society's office at 205 East 42d Street. Most people hear about the society through community and welfare organizations, including Catholic and Protestant missions and schools and universities.
Small, personal loans are still the society's main concern, but recently it has started some other projects.  In the early 1970's, it started a program of making three-year loans for up to $3,500 to members of the Lubavitcher community in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, who wanted to use the money as part of the down payment on their homes so they could maintain their base in the community. Mr. Belth said the society had made $380,000 in loans to 105 people for down payments. No money has been lost in the program, he said.
Another project provides loans for education in Jewish day schools. Last year, the society began a program of offering loans for college students.

Immigration1.0-35800,SOUTHWEST JOURNAL; A PASSION IN TRUFFLES FOR TEXAS,1984,7,new york times,By WAYNE KING,section a,869.0,"''It used to be said,'' Francois Picard observed with a Gallic flair for metaphor, ''that the truffle was the daughter of earth and thunder. In the old days they noticed that after a thunderstorm, the truffle bore fruit.''
Mr. Picard grew up in the heart of truffle country in southern France and has been involved with the black, spongelike fungus since he was a child tracking the lusty pigs that rooted for it under the oaks around his hometown of Perigord.
He now lives in Dripping Springs, 200 miles west of here in the Texas Hill Country. But he still harbors a passion for the truffle, which, at a heady $40 or so an ounce retail, he likes to call ''the black diamond'' of haute cuisine. What took him to Dripping Springs was limestone, which laces the soil of the Hill Country in abundance. The normally diffident truffles, it develops, is ardent for limestone. And so Mr. Picard hopes to make Dripping Springs the truffle capital of the world.
Article (Southwest Journal) focuses on efforts of Francois Picard to successfully grow truffles in Dripping Springs, Texas; notes US Border Patrol, which switched to cars, vans, spotter planes, helicopters and dirt bikes to track illegal aliens in 1920, has recently started experiment using men on horseback; notes decline in contributions has forced Oral Roberts's City of Faith Medical Center, Tulsa, Okla, to dismiss 204 or 907 employees (M)
Since the summer of 1982, when a French testing laboratory deemed the Hill Country soil a superb habitat for growing truffles, Mr. Picard has grown and transplanted 20,000 oak seedlings and inoculated their roots with the mycelia, or thallus, or vegetative part, of the tuber melanosporum, the name the black truffle answers to in scientific circles. For reasons best known to truffles and trees, the fungus hugs the roots of oak and filbert trees. The trees like it.
Mr. Picard has already committed about 3,000 truffle-kissed seedlings to the Hill Country earth. With the passage of time, five to 10 years, and the beneficent advent of a thunderstorm or two, each planting will yield a few ounces to four pounds of truffles a year. He is looking forward to harvest time.
Truffle hunters seldom use pigs anymore to root up the fungus. The pigs tend to get nasty when someone snatches away their nosh. So Mr. Picard has two truffle-snuffling dogs trained to do it. He is also working on a device that will detect the morsels' earthy odor electronically. Formidable!
Before it took on modern dress and a new name in the 1920's, the United States Border Patrol was the Mounted Patrol, and it guarded the nation's borders against illegal entry primarily on horseback.
It first mechanized with Model T's. Today its 3,000-member force works from cars, vans, spotter planes, helicopters and even dirt motorbikes.
Last week, according to Larry Teverbaugh, chief agent of the busy Laredo sector, the patrol ''came full circle.'' Three experienced agents there gave up their green vans and mounted cow ponies, starting a 30- day experiment to see if men on horses could do more to stem illegal- alien traffic than men in machines.
''They're working out extremely well,'' Mr. Teverbaugh said Friday. A night horseback patrol the night before resulted in a score of apprehensions, he said, and assisted in some 80 others by men in a supporting van and on foot. ''They kept a lot of people from running,'' he said of the 80 ''assists'' in which the actual capture was made by someone other than the rider. ''They know they can't outrun a horse.''
The horses can handle terrain too tough for vans or even the knobby- tired motorcycles, he said, and the extra height of a man on horseback provides a better view over the scrub.
The horses seemed to warm to the job. ''One of them spotted some aliens before our agent did,'' Mr. Teverbaugh said. ''He alerted, pricked up his ears - obviously something out in the brush. He put the agent right on them, like a bird dog.''
But even with men, machines and horses, Mr. Teverbaugh concedes, the flow of aliens is increasing. Arrests in the last month were up 38 percent over the like period of last year, and that has been the pattern for 10 years.
When Oral Roberts opened his City of Faith Medical Center, a clinic, hospital and research center in Tulsa, nearly three years ago, he asked Oklahoma health officials to authorize 777 beds. The state, noting studies indicating that the city already had more hospital beds planned than were needed, reluctantly approved a maximum of 294.
Now much of the hospital is empty, with only 81 beds occupied. That, with declining contibutions from the evangelists's worldwide ministries, has meant a budget shortage of $1 million dollars a month. As a result, 244 of the medical center's 907 employees have been dismissed.  The decline in contributions has also put employees of Oral Roberts University, which Mr. Roberts founded in Tulsa in the 1960's, on a short work week for the summer, and eliminated athletic scholarships for incoming freshmen in some sports.
The university has also closed its downtown public relations office, and 90 employees of the Oral Roberts Evangelical Association have been dismissed, in addition to 40 eliminated earlier through attrition.
In February Mr. Roberts wrote his Prayer Partners, as his supporters are called, appealing for increased donations, but the budgetary problems continued. Tim Colwell, Mr. Roberts's public relations director, said the decline in contributions was affecting similar ministries. ''Donations have fallen off drastically,'' he said, and that could ''affect the future of all ministries.''

Immigration1.0-35192,STATE DEPT. SAYS A 'SOVIET FRONT' WON'T GET VISAS,1982,6,new york times,"By JANE PERLEZ, Special to the New York Times",section 2,821.0,"The State Department said today that except in ''special circumstances,'' visas for ''members of Soviet-front groups'' wanting to attend the United Nations disarmament sessions would not be granted by the United States. The sessions start in New York on Monday.
The department defined the ''World Peace Council, its affiliates, and other Soviet-dominated and similar organizations'' as ''Sovietfront groups.''
''Barring special circumstances we expect that visas will not be issued to members of Soviet-front groups,'' the department said in a two-page statement released today on its visa policy toward the World Peace Council and associated organizations.
WASHINGTON, June 4 - The State Department said today that except in ''special circumstances,'' visas for ''members of Soviet-front groups'' wanting to attend the United Nations disarmament sessions would not be granted by the United States.Earlier Figure Incorrect
Restricted-travel visas have been granted or are being granted to 32 members of the World Peace Council who received official invitations from the United Nations to the disarmament sessions, a department spokesman, Alan Romberg, said. Mr. Romberg said that an earlier figure of 50, released by the department, had been incorrect.
The restricted visas were issued in accordance with an agreement between the United States and the United Nations that says that persons who have official invitations from the U.N. for U.N. business will be permitted to enter the United States, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said.
The restricted visas, which limit travel to within 25 miles of Columbus Circle, are known as C-2 visas. They are issued for a maximum of 29 days, the Immigration spokesman, Duke Austin, said.
In New York, Judge Pierre M. Leval of Federal District Court refused to order the Justice Department to process by Monday night the visa applications of 347 antinuclear-war activists, many from Japan, who want to attend the United Nations disarmament conference.
The New York Civil Liberties Union had complained of delays in visa processing, but the judge said that many of the applications had been ''submitted at the last minute'' and that there was no indication the Government was acting ''in bad faith.''

Speakers' Platform Sought
Meantime, organizers of a June 12 antinuclear march and rally in New York asked the Police Department for permission to set up a speakers' platform at 47th Street and First Avenue, the starting point for the march. Police officials were considering the request.
Mr. Romberg said that visa applications from 380 Japanese who did not have official invitations were under review by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Forty-eight other visa applications from non-Japanese who did not have official invitations were also under review, he said.
Mr. Romberg said he did not know whether all the applications under review were from the World Peace Council.  The policy statement on visas for the monthlong Second Special Session on Disarmament said in part: ''We do not have a policy of denying visas to advocates of nuclear disarmament.  ''As for Soviet-front groups, we are carefully reviewing visa applications from members of the World Peace Council, its affiliates, and other Soviet-dominated and similar organizations who are seeking to exploit activities related'' to the United Nations disarmament sessions ''just as they have sought to exploit peace movements elsewhere.''

'Longstanding Affiliation'
The statement continued: ''Cases will be reviewed individually to determine special circumstances. The World Peace Council and its affiliates have longstanding direct political and financial affiliation with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
''The Council's activities, policy line and financing indicated that it is an instrument of Soviet policy. Their actions led to their expulsions from other Western democracies in earlier years.
''Further details of the Council activities are outlined in the April 1982 Department of State publication entitled 'World Peace Council: Instrument of Soviet Policy.'
''The World Peace Council and its affiliates are thus among the types of organizations defined in section 212 (a) (28) of the Immigration and Nationality Act which render ineligible for a visa anyone who is a member of or affiliated with such an organization.''
Mr. Romberg said that the visa reviews were being conducted under the process set up by the McGovern Amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act. The amendment requires the State Department to seek waivers from the Immigration and Naturalization Service for those who would be barred from entry because of affiliation with Communist groups.

Immigration1.0-35753,TEHERAN SAYS U.S. SEARCHED HOME OF AN IRANIAN DIPLOMAT,1984,9,new york times,AP,section 1,293.0,"The Iranian press agency said today that United States security agents had searched the house of an Iranian diplomat in Washington soon after the car bombing of the United States Embassy in Beirut.
In a dispatch from Washington, the agency said that the diplomat, Ali Sabzalian, who is in charge of the Iranian interest section, was told later that he was being ''closely watched.''
Iranian press agency says US security agents accompanied by immigration officials searched house of Ali Sabzalian, Iranian diplomat in Washington, soon after car bombing of US Embassy in Beirut on Sept 20; INS spokesman denies knowledge of such an operation (S)
The connection between the bombing of the embassy in Beirut and the reported search of the Iranian diplomat's home in Washington was not clear. The shadowy Islamic Holy War organization has taken responsibility for the embassy bombing.
The Iranian press agency said:
''Security agents accompanied by officials from the United States immigration department searched the house of the diplomat, saying that guns and ammunition were in the house. The search proved futile but he was questioned at gunpoint.''
(In Washington, Greg Leo, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said he knew nothing about the search of the home of an Iranian diplomat. ''It bears no resemblance to anything we do operationally,'' he said. ''We perform our duties at ports of entry.'')
The Iranian agency said the security agents had said that they were unaware of Mr. Sabzalian's diplomatic status and had asked for his identity papers. They refused to identify themselves, the agency said.
In a further incident on Friday, the agency said, the diplomat was leaving his residence in a car with an Algerian diplomatic plate when he noticed that several cars were chasing him.
''The diplomat was later stopped by a police car and was asked for his driving license,'' the press agency said. ''The policeman warned him that he was being closely watched.''

Immigration1.0-35453,TENNIS DEFECTOR DIVIDES U.S. AIDES,1983,3,new york times,"By STUART TAYLOR Jr., Special to the New York Times",section a,756.0,"An application for political asylum by Hu Na, a 19-year-old Chinese tennis player, has provoked a ''unique'' disagreement between the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a Reagan Administration official close to the case said today.
''The whole case has been irregular,'' the official said. He said Miss Hu's case was the first in which the Immigration Service, which is part of the Justice Department, had failed to grant asylum quickly after a favorable recommendation had been made by the State Department.
No final action has been announced by the Justice Department. But Alan C. Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration Service, has failed for several months to follow the State Department's recommendation that asylum be granted.
WASHINGTON, March 30 - An application for political asylum by Hu Na, a 19-year-old Chinese tennis player, has provoked a ''unique'' disagreement between the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, a Reagan Administration official close to the case said today.
The Immigration Service appears to be worried that granting Miss Hu permission to stay would create a precedent that might be used by more than 1,000 other Chinese citizens now in this country who have applied for asylum. Fewer than a dozen of the requests have been approved.

Asylum Asked Last Summer
Miss Hu defected to the United States last July 20 during a tennis tournament in Santa Clara, Calif., and applied for political asylum July 26.
She said in an interview this month that she felt Chinese officials had been trying to coerce her into joining the Communist Party, and that she feared she would be caught up in factional political struggles in China.
High-level Peking officials have demanded that Miss Hu be returned to China. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said last week that Miss Hu would not be prosecuted if she returned to China and would be sent soon to play in a tournament in Switzerland.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Justice Department have the legal power to grant or deny asylum applications, and the State Department's formal role is limited to making recommendations.
But in practice, according to the Administration official, the State Department's advice ''is always followed.'' He said that ''the way things work in fact, the State Department makes the decision, and for it to be subjected to months of review at the I.N.S. is unique.''

Dissension 'Clearly' Seen
The Administration official, who requested anonymity, said that news reports that Mr. Nelson had suggested that Attorney General William French Smith deny Miss Hu asylum were consistent with what he had been told by another official close to the case.
He said that ''there has clearly been dissension'' within the Immigration Service as well as in the State Department about the case.
Mr. Nelson did not return a reporter's phone calls today. Verne Jervis, a spokesman for the Immigration Service, said he could neither confirm nor deny the reports, asserting that it was agency policy not to discuss ''any case that's under consideration.''
Mr. Jervis said the Immigration Service ''occasionally although rarely'' deviated from State Department recommendations in asylum cases.
Another Justice Department official said that Mr. Nelson had not yet made any written recommendation on Miss Hu's application.

More Details Requested
Terrence B. Adamson, a Washington lawyer representing Miss Hu, said in a telephone interview today that the Immigration Service had recently asked the State Department to provide more detailed reasons why Miss Hu should be granted asylum. The response, he said, was a cursory reaffirmation of the original recommendation.
''It sounds as if some official at some level of the Government has views on the process to be used in asylum cases inside the executive branch and not on the merits of Hu Na's well-documented application,'' Mr. Adamson said.
He expressed confidence that Miss Hu met the legal requirement for being granted asylum, which is that she have a ''well-founded fear of persecution'' if she were to return to China.
The State Department first recommended late last year that Miss Hu be granted asylum. This represented a victory for the Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, which favored her request, over the China desk, which was concerned that granting asylum would harm relations with Peking, the Administration official said. The dispute over Miss Hu's status has aggravated the strained relations between the two countries.

Immigration1.0-35202,THE CITY; Forger of Papers For Aliens Is Jailed,1982,5,new york times,By United Press International,section 2,137.0,"A 25-year-old Brooklyn College student was sentenced to six months in jail and fined $5,000 yesterday for providing forged documents to illegal aliens seeking to remain in the United States.
In sentencing the defendant, Jose Del Castillo of Manhattan, Judge Charles L. Brieant Jr. of Federal District Court in Manhattan said he was concerned that ''in times of high unemployment'' the Government was ''unable to or unwilling to enforce the immigration laws.''
A 25-year-old Brooklyn College student was sentenced to six months in jail and fined $5,000 yesterday for providing forged documents to illegal aliens seeking to remain in the United States.
A probation report on the defendant said he had ''provided forged documents for approximately 300 people, charging $300 to $500 per package.'' The allegation was disputed by Mr. Del Castillo, a native of the Dominican Republic, who has been in the United States for 12 years and is a permanent resident.

Immigration1.0-35797,THE DEMOCRATS IN SAN FRANCISCO; MONDALE PROMISES CAUSUS HE'LL FIGHT IMMIGRATION BILL,1984,7,new york times,UPI,section a,527.0,"Walter F. Mondale pledged today to work against an immigration bill strongly opposed by Hispanic leaders, but Hispanic delegates still threatened a boycott of the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention.
The guerrilla movement, sponsored by delegates committed to Senator Gary Hart and the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the Hispanic caucus continued despite efforts by caucus leaders, including San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros and Representatives Robert Garcia, Democrat of the Bronx, and Edward R. Roybal, Democrat of California.
Leaders of the insurgency say they will continue to press the boycott issue until Wednesday night's vote on the party's Presidential nomination.
After a one-hour meeting with Hispanic leaders, Mr. Mondale issued a statement calling the immigration bill ''harmful'' and saying it would ''cause human suffering.''
Representative Roybal, leader of the Hispanic Caucus, said he believed the Mondale statement would end the threat that Hispanic delegates would withhold their votes on the first ballot for the Presidential nomination Wednesday.
''It is good enough for the delegates and good enough for the convention,'' Mr. Roybal told reporters.

Stormy Meeting of Delegates
At an ensuing caucus marked by stormy debate, a boycott motion by Carlos Alcala, a California delegate, failed on a 39-to-39 vote. But Mr. Alcala said he would bring the motion up again at another caucus Wednesday and demand a roll-call of all Hispanic delegates and their alternates.
Mr. Mondale's statement said he had opposed the immigration legislation and would ''communicate'' that opposition to ''the legislative leadership.''
Still an issue for the Hispanic delegates is the position of organized labor.
Hispanic leaders have met with Lane Kirkland, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, and he was expected to issue a statement. Mr. Roybal said that Mr. Kirkland ''opposes the bill in its present form.''
That opposition is based on a provision of the bill that would allow large numbers of foreign agricultural workers into the country to do harvesting, a move that labor believes would take jobs away from American workers.
A number of Hispanic leaders, including several members of Congress, as well as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Mr. Mondale's son, William, appeared at the caucusg to plead for support.
Mario Obledo, president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, chief sponsor of the boycott demand, said his organization had set a deadline for action by both the party's leadership and organized labor to kill the immigration bill.
Privately, some Hispanic leaders said negotiations were under way between Hispanic leaders, House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. , and possibly Mr. Kirkland to work out a statement that would satisfy the Hispanic demand that the bill be killed when it is considered again by the House after the convention.
Many of the grass-roots delegates want a specific commitment that the party leadership will work to kill the bill when it comes out of a House-Senate conference after Congress returns Monday.

Immigration1.0-35349,"The Good, the Best and the Border",1983,9,new york times,,section a,551.0,"Hey, bud, you want some fake identification? It's not hard to find. In Texas, one forger provided whole ID packets, including Social Security card and birth certificate, for $75. If that's all an illegal alien needs to stay in this country, no wonder there are so many of them. Indeed, there's such a wave of false papers that some people now suggest surrendering to the illegal tide.
Editorial calls on House of Representatives to pass Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform measure; says measure has shortcomings, but it is good first step in halting tide of illegal aliens (M)
Sure, they say, Congress may finally be on the verge of passing the big Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform bill that's meant to put the United States back in control of its borders. But with all the forgeries, the argument goes, it can't work, so what's the use?
It's an infuriating attitude, so defeatist as to be suspect. Tax evasion is increasing as more and more cash changes hands in the underground economy. Does that mean the Internal Revenue Service should stop trying to enforce Title 26 of the U.S. Code? More people have been running red lights in New York City. Does that mean the police should stop giving out tickets?
Of course not, and to suggest that the nation should surrender to illegal immigration suggests a defeatism motivated by special, selfish interest. On immigration, there's plenty of that, ranging from growers who want cheap labor to Hispanic organizations that want easy entry.
If the United States is serious about controlling the borders, the Simpson-Mazzoli bill - already passed overwhelmingly by the Senate - is an essential starting point. There's no measure before the new session of Congress that more deserves public attention or prompt enactment by the House.
If controlling the borders is so important, why doesn't the Government enforce present laws against illegal entry? Heaven knows it tries. The Border Patrol is now up to 2,800 agents, an increase of 20 percent in just two years. But the task remains hopeless because what's on the books is more loophole than law.  Yes, it is illegal for undocumented individuals to enter the country and to take jobs here. But it is not illegal for an employer to hire them. So they keep flooding in, eager to take their chances as long as they can earn wages that are princely by comparison with wages at home in Mexico or elsewhere. Until Congress closes the loophole, what the United States displays at its borders is not a big stick but a big wink.  The Simpson-Mazzoli bill would not, by itself, create a big stick. It would be far stronger if it included a reasonable, built-in system of worker identification instead of leaving that to be dealt with in three years. But that's a perfectionist objection. Immigration is a subject torn by ideological contradictions and special interests. For the bill to have gotten this far has required repeated compromise.  Even if enacted, Simpson-Mazzoli could still be torpedoed. It could not work without sufficient enforcement funds or without further steps, like an identification system. But unless it is passed, nothing constructive is imaginable.  Simpson-Mazzoli is not the best possible immigration reform, yet it remains a good bill and a necessary one. Now it's up to the House leadership to insure that, after 19 months of debate, the measure does not falter on the last lap. To permit the best to become the enemy of the good can only insure victory for the worst.

Immigration1.0-35363,THE MAN BEHIND MARC RICH,1983,8,new york times,By ERIC N. BERG,section d,1908.0,"It is the classic immigrant success story. Speaking only a foreign tongue, a young man flees war-torn Europe for America where, after an apprenticeship in a business run by other immigrants, he starts his own firm and becomes a multimillionaire.
It is the story of how Marc Rich - Belgian-born Jewish refugee, a low ''B'' student in high school and the son of a burlap bag maker - became head of one of the largest commodity trading firms in the world.
It is also a story shrouded in secrecy, and one that has begun to turn sour.
For much of his childhood, Mr. Rich did not even speak English, let alone the arcane language of commodities.
Profile of Marc Rich, refugee from Nazi Europe who rose to establish Marc Rich & Co AG, $10-billion-a year commodity trading firm; describes firm's growth and US Government investigation of what it calls 'massive tax evasion scheme' (L)Extensive Commodity Knowledge
Today, however, Mr. Rich, who is now 48 years old, speaks perfect English and Spanish as well his native French. His knowledge of commodities, gleaned from years of experience at the old-line New York-based commodity firm of Philipp Brothers, is considered unrivaled in the industry.
Largely as a result of this knowledge, the commodity trading firm Mr. Rich started in 1974, Marc Rich & Company A.G. of Zug, Switzerland, has become a $10 billion-a-year organization considered among the most influential and successful in the industry. Indeed, the first public challenge to its reputation has been the investigation of the firm for engaging in what the United States Government calls ''a massive tax evasion scheme.''
For almost a year and a half, Government prosecutors have been trying to determine whether Marc Rich A.G. charged an artificially high price for oil sold to its United States subsidiary in order to reduce the subsidiary's 1980 income taxes. Led by an Assistant United States Attorney, Morris Weinberg Jr., the prosecutors have subpoenaed hundreds of thousands of Marc Rich documents, including telexes, bank statements, accounting records and interoffice correspondences.
The Rich companies have resisted the subpoenas. At first, Marc Rich A.G. officials argued that they did not have to comply because the firm is Swiss-based. Then, last Monday, they said that Marc Rich A.G. could not comply because Swiss authorities, citing that country's strict laws on corporate secrecy, had seized some of the requested papers.

Requests for Extensions
Until recently, Federal District Judge Leonard B. Sand seemed willing to accommodate Marc Rich A.G.'s requests for extensions to deadlines for producing the papers.
But in late June, Judge Sand began to put pressure on Marc Rich for the documents. On June 29, he found the company in contempt of court and levied a $50,000-a-day fine on Marc Rich A.G. until the subpoenaed documents had been surrendered.
On Aug. 5 it had appeared that the case was close to resolution when Marc Rich A.G. agreed to turn over the documents by the next day in return for the Government's agreement to lift a freeze on some of Marc Rich A.G.'s assets in the United States.
But the dramatic late-night airport seizure last week of two steamer trunks crammed with documents subpoenaed from Marc Rich A.G.'s domestic unit has cast fresh doubt on the firm's good will, Government prosecutors charge. They grabbed the trunks and their courier after stopping a commercial jet just before it was to take off for Switzerland.
And with reports circulating that Marc Rich A.G. may have asked the Swiss police to seize its documents, Judge Sand now appears fed up. At a hearing Monday, he threatened to shut down Marc Rich A.G.'s United States operations if the commodities firm does not deliver the papers.

$10 Billion in Trades
Thw company's operations are extensive. Last year, according to competitors, Marc Rich A.G.'s 450 employees in 40 offices worldwide traded more than $10 billion worth of commodities, including aluminum, bauxite, copper, lead, zinc, tin and crude petroleum. Its unit operating in the United States, Marc Rich & Company International Ltd., with 200 employees in New York, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Detroit, traded another $1 billion. Considered together, the firms were second in size to only Philipp Brothers, which trades more than $25 billion a year.
Marc Rich International was sold June 30 to Clarendon Ltd., a company that was formed for the sale and whose independence is now a key issue in Federal court.
Marc Rich has its headquarters in a steel-and-glass building in Zug, a small farming community near Zurich that is home to a number of large corporations because of its low taxes. Privately held, Marc Rich A.G. does not release financial results. But a recent magazine article estimated Mr. Rich's own net worth at $150 million.
Mr. Rich is co-owner of Marc Rich A.G. with Pincus (Pinky) Green, who is Mr. Rich's longtime friend and business associate. Along with Marvin Davis, a Denver oilman, Mr. Rich also has a controlling interest in the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation, which is now a private concern.

Series of Business Coups
Marc Rich A.G. attained its current size largely through a series of business coups that illustrate both the skill of its traders and the influence of Mr. Rich himself. In 1973 and 1974, for example, when Arab nations were attempting to cut off oil supplies to the United States, Marc Rich A.G. was able to purchase oil in the spot market and resell it to major United States refiners at prices double the prevailing world rate of $12 a barrel.
In 1979, when a shutoff of Iranian crude again threatened domestic oil supplies, Marc Rich A.G. earned huge premiums - as much as $14 a barrel, industry sources say - by supplying the Atlantic Richfield Company with Nigerian crude that the commodity trader had contracted for before the revolution in Iran.
And in early 1981, when falling tin prices threatened the economy of Malaysia, Mr. Rich demonstrated his own influence in world commodity markets. A close friend of Abdul Rahaim Aki, then the head of the Malaysian Mining Corporation, the state- owned tin company, Mr. Rich reportedly masterminded a plan to buy most of the world's tin, stockpile it, and inflate prices. The plan made Mr.  Rich a considerable amount of money before it finally collapsed when the United States stepped up tin sales from its own stockpiles.
Throughout these dealings, Mr. Rich and his firm have remained intensely secretive. Honoring a tradition of confidentiality dating to 15th- century Venetian silver merchants, they have refused to disclose the names of customers or suppliers or details of trades. Mr. Rich, who has maintained an apartment in Manhattan and a home in Lido Beach, L.I., has left the United States for Switzerland, as has Mr. Green. Both men have refused all requests for interviews.
The secrecy surrounding Mr. Rich is nearly as total as that surrounding his business dealings. It is known that Mr. Rich emigrated to the United States from Belgium when he was about 11 years old to escape the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II. Mr. Rich's father, David Rich, a maker of burlap and cotton bags, worked at the Melrose Bag and Burlap Company of Manhattan.
According to school records, Mr. Rich attended Forest Hills High School in Queens but later transferred to the Rhodes School, a college preparatory institution on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where he managed a low ''B'' average. He was president of the French club, and according to his report card, was ''a purposeful, actively creative boy with a strong commitment to moving ahead.''
After graduation, Mr. Rich enrolled at New York University to study marketing, but he never graduated.
He did get a job at Philipp Brothers Inc., which today is the trading arm of Phibro-Salomon Inc. When Mr. Rich began working at Philipp, the tight-knit group of German-Jewish metals traders took him under their wing and taught him their trade.

Considered a Rising Star of Firm
Mr. Rich became the protege of Ludwig Jesselson, then the chairman and chief executive of Philipp Brothers, and soon was regarded as one of the trading firm's rising stars.
''He was just an amazingly fast study,'' recalled one metals trader. ''You'd teach him something, and he'd learn it the first time - no questions asked. He was just an astute, very knowledgeable trader.''
In an industry filled with young millionaires, Mr. Rich was also known as a modest man, despite his talent for trades.
In 1973 and into 1974, Mr. Rich negotiated a series of deals that ultimately led to his departure in anger from Philipp. A co-founder of the oil- trading division at that firm, Mr. Rich had helped the firm earn millions of dollars by parlaying his contacts with Middle Eastern metals suppliers into oil contracts with countries that included Iran and Iraq. While other traders scrambled for supplies during the oil embargo, Philipp Brothers had all it needed - thanks to Mr. Rich. As a result, under Philipp Brothers' incentive program, Mr. Rich earned a bonus exceeding $1 million.

Dispute Over Bonus
But the bonus was never paid. According to current and former Philipp Brothers employees, the firm's management said that ''no single person deserved a seven-figure bonus.'' What is more, Mr. Rich, who had been considered next in line to succeed Mr. Jesselson, was told that he would not be getting the top spot. Incensed, Mr. Rich left Philipp Brothers to start his own firm and took a number of top traders, including Mr. Green, with him.
Since his departure, according to traders interviewed, Mr. Rich has been waging a vendetta against his former employer, instructing employees at times to take losses on trades if it meant stealing business from Philipp Brothers. Stories abound of the two firms hiring ''moles'' to spy on each other and of plotting to alure away each others' key traders.
On one occasion, according to John Hughes, a principal in the London- based commodity firm of LHW Futures, Philipp Brothers urged its bankers not to provide credit to Mr. Rich's fledgling firm. But Mr. Rich, in one of his earliest coups, was able to secure a contract to supply crude oil to Atlantic Richfield. With this as collateral, he acquired the bank credit needed to build his business.
Apart from his resentment toward his former boss, however, Mr. Rich has a reputation for being a quick- thinking, aggressive trader who encourages employees to take chances.
''The secret of success in this business is to spot trends,'' said Gerard F. Cerchio, the president of Sun International Inc., the trading arm of the Sun Company. ''Marc Rich spots trends quicker than anyone I know. He is also a bigger risk-taker than others.''
Working 14-hour days in an industry where prices change from minute to minute, Mr. Rich is said to take an unusual interest in his staff, traveling often, visiting staff members in remote trading outposts to let them air their concerns.
One commodity industry executive recalled an occasion in which Mr. Rich, on a tour of his New York office, stopped to help a secretary struggling to repair a typewriter.
''He went over to see if he could help her,'' the executive recalled.  ''He is just very sensitive to the needs around him.''
And, his associates say, he has maintained his modesty.
''You wouldn't know Marc Rich from a $30,000-a-year bank executive,'' said Mr. Hughes, of LHW Futures. ''There is nothing ostentatious about him.''
Commenting on the fact that Mr. Rich wears a relatively inexpensive Seiko wristwatch, Mr. Hughes said, ''He is just not a high-profile glamour boy.''

Instead they are perceived as having climbed through a what one Government lawyer called ''a window of vulnerability'' that a Federal court in Miami may have opened a bit wider last week.
Federal District Judge orders Government to parole detained Haitians pending hearings to determine political or economic refugee status
Federal District Judge Eugene P. Spellman ordered the Government to parole 1,900 Haitians, most of whom have been locked up more than a year, pending hearings on whether they are political or economic refugees. The former would be granted asylum; the latter sent back to Haiti.
Lawyers for the Haitians said Judge Spellman's decision was a ''major victory'' and expressed hope that it would lead to ''a reasonable and orderly release process to remedy this awful detention.'' But it may be a while before celebrations are in order.  Judge Spellman refused to stay his order and the Justice Department filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals in Atlanta.  The appeal could take as long as a year and the Justice Department said the Haitians would continue to be detained in the meantime.

Immigration1.0-35111,The Nation in Summary; SEnate Passes Immigration Law Changes,1982,8,new york times,"By Michael Wright, Carlyle C. Douglas and Caroline Rand Herron",section 4,392.0,"Amid rising concern over strangers at the gates, the Senate last week approved one of the most significant revisions of immigration law in 30 years. The measure would grant amnesty to millions who entered the country illegally before 1980, but was aimed at reducing the number who slip across the border in the future, largely by punishing those who hire them.
The bill, sponsored by Republican Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, won broad support in the Senate - the vote was 81 to 18 - and Attorney General William French Smith urged the House to ''act swiftly in the same spirit of reason and reform.'' However, there was some question whether the House would have time this year, barring a post-election session.
Senate passes immigration law changes
Representative Peter W. Rodino, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, is known to favor penalizing those who knowingly employ illegal aliens - the measure calls for fines of up to $2,000 per illegal worker and jail sentences for repeat offenders. However, aides said he would seek to change some other provisions of the bill when his committee takes it up after Labor Day. At the very least, the New Jersey Democrat is expected to try to kill a section that would eliminate the immigration preference now given to the alien siblings of American citizens.
The bill's other main provisions include an annual immigration limit of 425,000, not counting refugees, with no more than 20,000 coming from any country other than Canada and Mexico, which would be allowed 40,000 each; a requirement that all job applicants prove they are either citizens or authorized aliens; and a requirement that the President establish within three years a ''a secure system to determine employment eligibiilty.'' The bill did not specify just what the system must be, but some have interpreted it as a call for national identity cards.
The chief opponent in the Senate was Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who argued that in many ways the bill restricted immigration instead of reforming it. He agreed with some Hispanic groups that opposed the measure on the ground that its ''employer sanctions'' could result in increased discrimination against Hispanic Americans.

Immigration1.0-35345,"The Speaker, on the Border",1983,9,new york times,,section 4,448.0,"Two tides are running in America. One is at the border, a flood of illegal immigrants fleeing political turmoil and economic stagnation. The other is subtler, a wave of reaction so ugly that it threatens legal, healthy, necessary immigration.
Editorial favors passage of Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill that would forbid employers to hire illegal aliens and provide amnesty for those who have lived in US
Both tides should - and can - be turned. After five years of study by a special commission and then by Congress, the House of Representatives can now, finally, bring the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform bill to a vote. The Senate passed it overwhelmingly last year and did so again last spring. But in the House last year, the bill died as the clock ran out. This year, the same thing is starting to happen again. It's do-or-die time.
Consider who wants this bill, or who at least is willing to stop blocking it:
Big business is for it. And just last week, a body called the Labor Management Group, implying support for the bill, strongly urged that the bill be permitted to come to a vote. One head of that body is the chairman of Exxon. The other is the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Hispanics are for it, or at least for its approach. Though leaders of Hispanic organizations oppose the bill, a national survey last summer showed that a substantial majority of Hispanics favor its two major themes - finally forbidding employers to hire illegal aliens and providing amnesty for those who've lived here, fearful and exploited, for years.  President Reagan has repeatedly expressed his support.  The Senate has passed it twice.  The House Judiciary Committee is for it, 20-9.Representative Pepper, the Rules Committee chairman, is for it. He intends to take it up on Oct. 18, possibly clearing the way for a floor vote.  Representative Wright, the House majority leader whom some blamed for stalling last year, said recently that he wants it to be considered ''on this floor.'' And there's good reason to think the whole House is for it. A canvass last fall showed strong support for its major provisions.  One name, however, is conspicuously missing from this list: Speaker O'Neill. It's not clear what he thinks of immigration reform on the merits, but that's just the point.  Perhaps a partisan case could be made for denying the President a victory he might celebrate in the coming campaign. What a tragedy that would be for a reform that so many, from all points on the political spectrum, have worked so long to achieve.  Or perhaps Mr. O'Neill simply wishes to remain unclear, holding himself back in some border zone of neutrality. But the time for neutrality is running out. If the Speaker of the House wants the bill to come to a vote, it will. If not, the danger, as the days dwindle down, is death by suffocation.

Immigration1.0-35095,The Unlucky 49,1982,9,new york times,,section a,410.0,"There are now 49 of them in the ''Carter Class,'' three having gone back to Haiti and one having won a medical release. They are called that because, of the 1,900 Haitian migrants detained in this country, they are the only ones involved in a New York case, decided last spring by Federal District Judge Robert Carter.
The Justice Department, under impatient court orders in a parallel Florida case, is releasing all the rest. But it has refused again to release the 49, who have been held in a Brooklyn detention center for 13 months. Why?
Editorial comments on Federal Court decision concerning Haitian refugees detained in Brooklyn (NY)
They're all likely to abscond, says Charles Sava, New York District Director of Immigration. Oh, and their cases have been denied by immigration judges, and their chances on appeal are poor. Yes, they have all been offered bond, and sponsorship by established resettlement agencies - but that, says Director Sava, is not persuasive.
And in Washington, a spokesman for the Immigration Service declares that ''The rules say that if illegal aliens come to this country without proper documentation they will be detained. All we're doing is enforcing the law.''
Enforcing the law?  Even if the 49 Haitians are eventually adjudged to be illegal immigrants, not entitled to refugee status because they came here seeking opportunity, legality is not the issue. The issue is comparability, elemental fairness and equal protection.
There is only one way in which the situation of the 49 differs from that of the 1,900 being released under the Florida order: the legal accident that put them in a different case.
What kind of law enforcement is it that seizes on such a distinction as the basis for keeping poor people, not guilty of any crime, locked up for 13 months, and typically allowed to go outside only four times in that period?
What kind of mindless rules require leaving them to sit staring out the window, or talking on pay phones, or in some cases attempting suicide? What kind of cold law insists on such relentlessness for these few when the Justice Department is releasing the many?
If the Immigration Service and Attorney General Smith are not moved by logic, if they are not moved by humanity, then how shall they be moved? For this is not law enforcement at all. By any standard of comparability or fairness, it is incomprehensible cruelty.

Immigration1.0-35410,TO JUDGE A PLEA FOR ASYLUM FAIRLY AND SPEEDILY,1983,5,new york times,,section a,299.0,"To the Editor:
Your editorial outlined with admirable clarity the dilemmas in responding to the claims of those seeking asylum status. I share your concern that ''decisions verging on refoulement (forcible subjection to peril) ought to involve some independent judgment.''
Your editorial outlined with admirable clarity the dilemmas in responding to the claims of those seeking asylum status.
Last week, I exercised my citizen's right to attend a public hearing of an Afghan inmate at the Brooklyn Naval Detention Center on his application for political asylum, even though I had to pass three locked doors to do so.
In the first five minutes, the hearing examiner refused the motion that the proceedings be simultaneously translated. After an hour of legal discussion in English, questions were put to the individual in Farsi through an interpreter.
In a particular matter, it was clear that he did not understand the context of the question, and his reply was taken as proof of bad faith. Had he been informed of the point of the question, he would have been able to give the obvious explanation for a particular discrepancy. As it was, he was in tears from the aggressiveness of the prosecuting counsel's questioning.
The hearing took place inside the detention center, where the individual had been incarcerated for several months on presumption of guilt (illegal entry). Even if he appeals the decision against him, he will remain incarcerated pending the scheduling of his appeal, if the present policies of the Immigration and Naturalization Service governing arrivals from Afghanistan are allowed to stand.
Not unreasonably, the Afghans who have been stewing in the detention center for 15 months or more cannot understand why they, of all those claiming political asylum, are being so treated by the U.S.

Immigration1.0-35004,TO STOP THE 'ANARCHY' IN U.S. IMMIGRATION,1982,12,new york times,,section a,414.0,"To the Editor:
Joaquin Avila, president of Maldef, the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund (Op-Ed Dec. 17), is in a better position than most to know that the failure of state employer-sanction laws to deter illegal immigration, rather than being an argument against the nowfailed Simpson-Mazzoli bill, is a confirmation of the ever more urgent need for strong Federal leadership in immigration enforcement.
he states' unfamiliarity with immigration and nationality practice, the deficiencies of most current ID documents and our courts' uncertainties about the proper state role in immigration have all worked to undermine the effectiveness of state laws. In at least one state, California, litigation supported by special-interest groups, such as Maldef, helped stall enforcement.
Joaquin Avila, president of Maldef, the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund (Op-Ed Dec. 17), is in a better position than most to know that the failure of state employer-sanction laws to deter illegal immigration, rather than being an argument against the nowfailed Simpson-Mazzoli bill, is a confirmation of the ever more urgent need for strong Federal leadership in immigration enforcement.
The experience clearly shows that strong Federal leadership, based on a comprehensive, tamperproof, nondiscriminatory ID system, is a must. Mr. Avila's misgivings notwithstanding, the remarkably low percentage of error and fraud in the astronomical volume of credit card transactions shows that it is technically attainable.
And after reading his arguments, I wondered why Maldef opposed the bill at all, since employers' greed, the porosity of any ID system, the exception planned for small enterprises and the expanded temporary-workers program would add up to just as many or more immigrants as ever.
Perhaps Maldef's greatest fear was not that the bill would not have worked but that it just might have begun to end the current anarchy, in which so many have a stake, and to channel long-established flows of undocumented immigration into legal channels.
Mr. Avila mischaracterizes the objectives of immigration reform as ''to stop the flow of immigrants and to save, for citizens, jobs now held by undocumented workers.'' More accurately, the bill would have reasserted control over our borders, once again making the composition and volume of our annual immigration flow a matter of national choice rather than a process of immigrant self-selection.
It may well be that we will accept as much or more immigration once we have reasserted control, but at least we as a society will be able to say it was not left entirely to chance.  DAVID E. SIMCOX Washington, Dec. 20, 1982

Immigration1.0-35836,"TWO MEN WHO FASHIONED IMMIGRATION BILL AND LED IT THROUGH CONGRESS; ROMANO MAZZOLI DEVOTED FOUR YEARS OF QUIET, RELETNLESS WORK TO MEASURE",1984,6,new york times,By STEVEN V. ROBERTS,section d,814.0,"The ordeal was almost over and Representative Romano L. Mazzoli was all but spent. ''I was at my mother's this weekend and I almost fell asleep into the spaghetti,'' he said.
The Kentucky Democrat lost 12 pounds along with his sleep, and his face took on a gaunt look. But he won a four-year battle in the House over altering the nation's immigration laws when the House voted today to approve legislation that Mr. Mazzoli and Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, wrote. The Senate passed a slightly different version last year.
Profile of Rep Romano L Mazzoli, one of chief sponsors of immigration bill; photo (M)
''I'm going to carve a very modest role around this place,'' said Mr. Mazzoli, a 14-year veteran of the House who seems to believe in his own obscurity. ''But I wanted to prove to the country and to the leadership that we could deal with an emotionally laden and divisive subject in a way that brought credit to the House.''
Immigration is one of the most emotional issues Congress ever considers, and the Simpson-Mazzoli bill contains two sections that rankle large numbers of voters. The House and Senate versions give legal status to aliens who came here illegally but have been here for a number of years, and both impose penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal workers.

Assailed From Both Sides
Accordingly Mr. Mazzoli has been assailed from both sides and the 51- year-old lawmaker jokes: ''I used to be 6 foot 7 until they kept pounding me down. Then I became 5 foot 9.''
In an unusual tribute to the lawmaker some of his colleagues took the floor at one late-night session to praise his stewardship of the bill. Representative Abraham Kazen Jr., Democrat of Texas, said Mr. Mazzoli had taken criticism ''bordering on abuse,'' but in the end he ''has really withstood one of the sternest tests'' ever faced by a Congressman.
The most common criticism of the bill is that it would cause employers to discriminate against Hispanic and other foreign-looking workers.
''He doesn't understand the importance of the bill in the Hispanic community,'' said Representative Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico whose mother was born in Mexico. ''It's a blind spot with him, but an honest blind spot. He's a very fair man.''

'A Conservative Guy'
A liberal Democrat on the Judiciary Committee added, ''Remember he's a conservative guy. He votes with the Republicans as much as with the Democrats.''
Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California, who opposed the bill, said Mr. Mazzoli ''plays hardball'' when it comes to legislation but plays it well. ''He just very skillfully overcame all the roadblocks,'' Mr. Edwards said.
Mr. Mazzoli's father left Northern Italy 70 years ago and settled in Louisville where he worked as a tile setter. The younger Mazzoli was first elected to Congress by 211 votes and has had, by his own testimony, a ''constant struggle'' to keep his seat against Republican challengers.
He made few ripples in his first 10 years in the House and says of himself: ''Some people are flamboyant and some are not. I'm one of the are nots.'' But in 1980 Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York Democrat who headed the subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law, left Congress to make an unsuccessful run for the Senate.

Bill Blocked in House
As a result of this ''purely accidental'' development, Mr. Mazzoli inherited the post and began what he calls his ''roller-coaster odyssey.'' The Simpson-Mazzoli bill passed the Senate twice in the next three years but was repeatedly blocked in the House when Hispanic groups convinced Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House, that it would harm their constituents.
The three surviving Democratic Presidential contenders opposed the bill because of its employer sanctions. The measure received another blow when Representative Kent Hance, Democrat of Texas, almost won his party's Senatorial nomination by attacking the bill's plan to legalize millions of aliens.
That race revealed the political pitfalls in the bill and Mr. Mazzoli says the Hance campaign ''broke my heart.'' Indeed, Mr. Mazzoli's Republican foe this year is attacking him for spending so much time trying to legalize undocumented workers.
Speaker O'Neill eventually agreed that the House should debate the measure, but the Speaker was so cool to the bill that the sponsor felt he was trying to ''kill it with apathy.'' Mr. Mazzoli was on his own and when the bill first came to the floor last week the Kentuckian had so few allies he was constantly scurrying around lobbying his colleagues to support his bill.
But after a day or two the House came to realize that the Simpson- Mazzoli bill was going to pass. Four years of quiet but relentless effort were coming to a climax.
''Mazzoli was enormously effective at building coalitions and getting votes,'' conceded Mr. Richardson. ''He whipped us good.''

Immigration1.0-35185,U.S. ANNOUNCES NEW POLICY FOR PAROLE OF SOME HAITIANS,1982,6,new york times,"By GREGORY JAYNES, Special to the New York Times",section a,1013.0,"The Justice Department announced today that it was issuing guidelines for the release of some Haitians from Federal detention facilities. The Haitians would be paroled to sponsors while they awaited hearings on whether they would be deported.
Many of the nearly 2,000 Haitians have been detained as long as a year under a Reagan Administration policy designed to discourage illegal immigration.
The latest action, essentially a return to the policy of a year ago, was announced this afternoon in Federal District Court here, where a ruling on a lawsuit that seeks to free the Haitians is expected any day. Attorneys for the plaintiffs and other advocates for Haitians in Miami said the timing of the announcement indicated that the Government expected to lose the case and had changed its policy to save face.
MIAMI, June 14 - The Justice Department announced today that it was issuing guidelines for the release of some Haitians from Federal detention facilities.
The new guidelines, set forth in a memorandum from Attorney General William French Smith to the Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner, Alan Nelson, allow parole for Haitians who are represented by individual counsel, have a ''responsible sponsor'' and can offer ''acceptable assurances'' that they will appear for court hearings.

Forms of Acceptable Assurance
Acceptable assurance, said Robert Bombaugh, a Justice Department trial lawyer, could be a pledge from relatives or others of longstanding residence in the community, or could be in the form of ''reasonable bonds.''
The condition of ''reasonable bonds'' raised immediate concern among those attempting to aid the Haitians. ''It sounds fairly good in theory and easily manipulated in practice,'' said Ira Kurzban, one of the principal lawyers in the lawsuit, which was filed in behalf of the Haitians in detention as a class. ''For example,'' he said, ''say they ask $2,000 bond. No one gets out.''
The Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, executive director of the Haitian Refugee Center Inc. in Miami, said that if ''it is implemented properly, it is a fair proposal,'' adding: ''The only thing I'm concerned about is the bonding. If they ask $500 to $2,000, we're back to Square One again.''
Mr. Bombaugh said that he could not ''get into details'' and that a meeting with immigration officials had been set for Thursday to ''discuss details of the implementation.''
He said the move ''does not in any way resolve the issues currently before this court.'' Judge Eugene Spellman, who is hearing the case, agreed, saying he would make his decision in the lawsuit before the end of this week. The judge and Mr. Bombaugh agreed to meet June 23 with the Dade County Bar Association and voluntary sponsoring groups to work out the procedures for those eligible for release.

600 Held at Miami Center
About 600 Haitians are being held at the Krome Avenue Detention Facility, a former missile base 25 miles west of Miami. There are 650 at the Fort Allen Detention Facility in Puerto Rico, and the rest of the 2,000 are being held at Federal correction facilities in Kentucky, New York, Texas and West Virginia. Civil libertarians contend they are political refugees and ought to be released.
The lawsuit seeks to prove that the Government's detention of Haitians is discriminatory because aliens of other nationalities are routinely released. The Government contends that the Haitians are treated ''specially,'' though not discriminatorily, in part because, while they are seeking political asylum, the Government's position is that they have come here for economic reasons.
Other aliens without proper documents are routinely expelled, Government witnesses said, while the Haitians have prolonged their incarceration with petitions for political asylum and class-action lawsuits. The detention policy, according to testimony, was adopted last summer as a deterrent to further illegal immigration. It was also put into effect after it was discovered that more than 20,000 Haitians who were paroled in the custody of sponsors over the last decade, pending exclusionary hearings on their cases, never appeared for the hearings.
About 800 of the Haitians are represented by lawyers and apparently would be the first to be considered for parole. But an agreement between the Government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico stipulates that Haitians cannot be released there. Judge Spellman asked Mr.  Bombaugh about that today, but he could not say what would be done with those now held on the island.

'Abuse' of Parole Asserted
Until last summer, the immigration service, after a cursory medical examination, routinely paroled Haitians who arrived in the United States illegally. Mr. Bombaugh said that the policy was ''abused'' and that it ''caused more, not less, illegal immigration.''
The new, much stricter parole policy will be ''monitored closely,'' Mr. Bombaugh said. The numbers of Haitians who do not show up for hearings will be ''kept track of,'' he said, adding that if it is found that the paroles are ''encouraging more illegal immigration,'' the program will be rescinded.
Asked in Washington whether the timing of the announcement was connected to the lawsuit in Miami, Associate Attorney General Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of the witnesses in the two-month trial, said it was ''not in any way an attempt to influence'' the judge's decision.
Commissioner Nelson said in an interview, ''We are not in any way backing off or waivering from the detention policy.'' Mr. Kurzban speculated that the Reagan Administration had ''gotten a lot of political heat,'' and ''felt they were going to lose the case.'' He said, ''This was a way of softening the blow and making it look like they were doing it on their own.''
There was no word of reaction by those being held at the Krome Facility, which has barred all visitors except for immediate relatives because of ''rising tension.''

Immigration1.0-35431,U.S. Ordered to Justify Afghans' Confinement,1983,5,new york times,,section 1,160.0,"A Federal judge yesterday gave the Government 20 days to file papers supporting its position that it is acting legally in confining 40 Afghan aliens in a detention center in Brooklyn.
The Afghans have been in custody at the Immigration and Naturalization Service center at 136 Flushing Avenue, some for as long as 15 months, while their bids for political asylum are considered.
A Federal judge yesterday gave the Government 20 days to file papers supporting its position that it is acting legally in confining 40 Afghan aliens in a detention center in Brooklyn.They say they fled oppression by the Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan. Immigration officials say the aliens are being detained because they tried to enter the United States without legal documents.
The 20-day deadline was given by the judge, Charles P. Sifton of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, in a proceeding brought by the Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights, which is seeking release for the Afghans while their asylum claims are litigated.
An Immigration Service spokesman said late yesterday that most of the Afghans were continuing a hunger strike.
