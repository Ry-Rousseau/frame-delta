      "For someone whose affably rumpled appearance suggests Matt Damon waking up from a nap, the comedian Mike Birbiglia is remarkably industrious. He is a film-maker (movies include Don’t Think Twice, a comedy about an improv group starring Keegan-Michael Key) and an actor (The Fault in Our Stars, Orange Is the New Black), and he recently played Taylor Swift’s avaricious son, who discovers at her funeral that he has been left out of her will, in the video for Anti-Hero. He also has a podcast, The Old Ones, in which celebrity guests pick apart his earlier standup routines, and another, Working It Out, in which they help him develop new material. “Like Tom Sawyer getting his friends to paint the fence,” as one guest, Nathan Lane, memorably put it.\n",
      "Now the 45-year-old is bringing his latest show, The Old Man and the Pool, to the UK after a sell-out Broadway run. If he had his way, he wouldn’t reveal anything about it in advance. “I’d just say, ‘I wrote a show about mortality and I guarantee you’ll laugh for 80 minutes straight and sometimes people also feel emotions from it and – trust me – I think you’ll love it.’” He is speaking to me from his Brooklyn apartment, a large ceiling fan whirring sleepily above him so that it looks like his head has propellers.\n",
      "Millions trust Birbiglia already. This is his fifth show, with three of the others – My Girlfriend’s Boyfriend, Thank God for Jokes and The New One – available as Netflix specials. His routines are intimate and convivial, peppered with delicious phrasing and zinging observations. He talks on stage about his wife, the poet J Hope Stein, whose soothing voice has “a thread-count of 600”; he bemoans the arrogance of the bed, the only item of furniture to have an entire room named after it; and he makes good-egg, commonsense arguments, such as his plea against tardiness: “It’s so easy to be on time because all you have to do is be early – and ‘early’ lasts for hours.”\n",
      "The Old Man and the Pool begins with a catastrophic midlife MOT. Healthcare appointments usually spell trouble for Birbiglia, who had bladder cancer at the age of 20 and still suffers from a severe sleep-walking disorder that requires him to go to bed each night in a sleeping bag while wearing mittens to prevent him from unzipping himself. Prior to his diagnosis, he once jumped through a closed second-storey window of his hotel room while asleep.\n",
      "This time around, he has pulmonary issues. “The doctor asked me to blow into a tube,” he recalls. “Then he said, ‘If I was going just by this, I’d say you’re having a heart attack right now.’ I did it a second time and he said, ‘I don’t know what to tell you…’” There was reason to worry: his father had his first heart attack in his 50s, while his grandfather suffered a fatal one around the same age. “He worked in a bodega in Brooklyn. One day a regular came in and said, ‘How’s it going, Joe?’ And he keeled over the counter and died. Which is sad but, in a way, also the funniest response you could possibly have. I think of him as the original comedian of the family. That is an extraordinary level of commitment.”\n",
      "To add to his problems, Birbiglia was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Cue a tale of fear, panic and grudging exercise at his local YMCA, which gives the show its Hemingway-riffing title and makes possible the eye-catching set: a tiled tidal wave looming over Birbiglia. (Think of it as the pool of Damocles.) The heavy stuff is leavened by his springy delivery and niceness, though he bristles slightly when I use that word: “I don’t know if the audience needs me to be ‘nice’ so much as ‘human’.”\n",
      "There are also odes to blissful domesticity: he and Stein have an eight-year-old daughter, Oona, whose birth was the subject of The New One, and whose chit-chat features in the latest show without tipping too far into kids-say-the-funniest-things terrain. Today, he is wearing a bracelet she made for him, its beads spelling out the word “silly”– a daily reminder to salt his talk of death with daftness, and one he has no trouble heeding.\n",
      "Indeed, audiences will rarely have laughed so much while being invited to contemplate their own extinction. “All my shows,” he says, “are about the value of fearlessness when it comes to being truthful with the people you love, and how that can make us closer to each other. But this show is like the icebreaker of all icebreakers. If you don’t have a deep conversation afterwards with the person you came in with, then you probably never will.”\n",

Hooker has played 31 games over the past two seasons after being limited to 36 games with the Colts.\\nThe 27-year-old tied Trevon Diggs for second on the club with three interceptions last season. Diggs, who led the NFL and tied a team record with 11 interceptions in 2021, just signed a $97 million extension.\\nHooker, Donovan Wilson and Jayron Kearse have teamed to give the Cowboys their best group of safeties in years.

       " 'article_text': 'A fan leaned over the first base dugout the other day to yell to Mets owner Steve Cohen.\\n“Get Ohtani,” said the fan, likely out of desperation.\\nCohen answered quickly and good-naturedly, “Who’s he?”\\nA few moments later Cohen explained to The Post that he and the Mets are concentrating on more current issues. There are presumably two reasons for this: 1) It helps them stay within baseball rules disallowing tampering with other teams’ stars, and 2) there’s plenty to try to correct right there in front of them.\\nLater in that pregame conversation, Cohen noted with a smile — and perhaps slightly sarcastically, at least I hope it was sarcasm — that they were two games over .500. (This was before two more defeats dropped them to an even .500.)\\nAnd lest anyone who hasn’t been paying close attention thinks that’s a fluke, please note that they tote a negative-12 run differential. So yes, they are fortunate to be .500.\\nThey are also lucky to be in the National League, which is playing like the senior circuit (as in very old) and allowing the eminently average to contend. Two games separate the Mets from a playoff spot following their sweep at the hands of the Blue Jays, fourth-place denizens of the AL East.\\nMets manager Buck Showalter said, rather hopefully, following Sunday’s defeat, “We are capable of better.” (If you study the transcription of Showalter speak, you will indeed find some pearls in the word salad, and I’d rate this as one.)\\nPerhaps we shall soon find out if it’s true. Among their next five opponents — starting Tuesday at the first-place Braves, their noted nemesis — are four winning teams plus the St. Louis Cardinals, who are one of maybe five teams as or more disappointing than the Mets (the Padres, Phillies, White Sox and Mariners may qualify as well).\\nI do think there’s a chance Buck’s right (he usually is, except when pitching to Vladimir Guerrero Jr.). Anyway, here’s a little bit of evidence the Mets are capable of better. Or at least that they have to be: If one were to hand out grades to all the Mets, the only one who’d get a solid, no-questions-asked A is closer David Robertson, who, as we know, was sadly pressed into that role when Edwin Diaz went down celebrating before the season even began.\\nRobertson really has been perfect* (I don’t count pitching to Guerrero Saturday, as he should have been ordered to walk him), and everyone else has been something less.\\nThe fans are starting to notice, as the booing has migrated beyond poor Daniel Vogelbach, who never deserved the brunt of their ire (he’s paid $1.5 million, which is practically volunteer work by big-league standards). They’ve even hit lately on Francisco Lindor, the $341 million man, whose glove is apparently the most valuable one in baseball (Showalter mentioned he’s been good defensively, which really isn’t much of a defense for a man with a $34.1M annual salary.)\\nReally, you can’t blame Lindor entirely. He is overworked, especially with the team’s only true backup shortstop, Luis Guillorme in Triple-A. The only reason I can figure Guillorme was demoted is because they must have too many good players. But we know that can’t be the case, or they wouldn’t be out of the playoff picture while the small-market Pirates and the smaller-revenue Marlins are in.\\nIt’s only right fans are starting to catch on that this isn’t all on Vogelbach, though he does need to lift the ball more (and that .315 slugging percentage) to fit his job description as designated hitter. He may not even be around forever, as more good players are on the way — Omar Narvaez, the original starting catcher, should be activated Tuesday — so it’s only smart that fans have started in on some real culprits.\\nLindor’s average is .214, he has whiffed eight times in his last 12 at-bats and he may need a day off (though it’s hard to see that happening against the hated Braves).\\nStarling Marte is still toting a below-average .314 on-base percentage, which is a shame since the new rules allow him to steal at will (17 of 20 so far).\\nThe best thing about Jeff McNeil’s appearances lately is his walk-up music (Def Leppard, he is apparently an old soul). Anyway, Joel Sherman pointed out that he has one extra-base hit in his last 31 games.\\nEven Pete Alonso, who isn’t far off his goal of a 60-homer pace (he’s at 56.7 at last count), is slumping.\\nOverall, the Mets are 22nd in OPS at .713, which can’t entirely be Vogelbach’s fault. Also, they rarely get a hit with runners in scoring position (0-for-19 vs. the Jays).\\nAt these prices — a record $377M payroll — it’s a wonder Cohen maintains his good humor. Things look so bad now, maybe even Ohtani couldn’t make a difference.\\nTruthfully, the big thing that is keeping them going now is their belief, as Buck said, that they are capable of better. Let’s hope, with 100-plus games to go, that is really the case.',\n",

The fish are tough, air-breathing fish that can survive outside of water for extended periods of time.\\n\"It is recommended to kill them by removal of the head, removal of the gill arches, or removal of the internal organs. Northern Snakeheads produce white meat fillets that are considered desirable table fare. Carcasses may also be disposed of appropriately in the trash or used as garden fertilizer,\" the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission said in the release.\\nNorthern snakeheads were first discovered in the mid-Atlantic region in 2002 when they were found in a Maryland pond. Snakeheads were first confirmed in Pennsylvania in July 2004. The first northern snakehead was caught in the Monongahela River in 2019.')"

Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces, commanded by Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, exploded into open fighting in Khartoum and elsewhere.\\nIn a speech broadcast on Sudan TV, Burhan accused the RSF and Dagalo of committing violations under the falsehood of promising to restore democracy.\\n“How can you bring about democracy by committing war crimes?” he said, in a speech celebrating Sudan’s annual armed forces day.\\nEarlier this month, rights organization Amnesty International accused both sides of committing extensive war crimes, including deliberate killings of civilians and mass sexual assault. In its 56-page report, the group said almost all rape cases were blamed on the RSF and its allied Arab militias.\\nIn Darfur, the scene of genocidal war in the early 2000s, the conflict has morphed into ethnic violence, with the RSF and allied Arab militias targeting African communities in the western region, U.N. officials say.\\nLast week the violence intensified in South Darfur province, killing dozens. The Darfur Bar Association, a Sudanese legal group focusing on human rights in the western Darfur region, said at least five civilians died in crossfire during intense clashes between the military and the RSF in Nyala, South Darfur’s capital, on Friday.\\nSome 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Nyala, Arab tribesmen riding RSF vehicles raided the Kubum area of South Darfur last week, burning down the local market and sacking a police station, the legal group said in a separate statement. At least 24 people were killed in the attack, it said.\\nLast month, Karim Khan, a prosecutor from the International Criminal Court, told the United Nations that he would be investigating alleged new war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur.\\nThe nearly four-month conflict has also reduced the capital, Khartoum, to an urban battlefield. Across the city, RSF forces have commandeered homes and turned them into operational bases, residents and doctors groups say. The army, in turn, has struck residential areas from the air and with artillery fire. Over 2.15 million people have since fled Khartoum state, according to U.N. data.\\nThe country’s health minister, Haitham Mohammed Ibrahim, said in June that the conflict has killed upward of 3,000 people but there has been no update since. The true tally is likely far higher, say local doctors and activists.\\nMeanwhile, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, confirmed to The Associated Press that it had suspended the RSF’s account and the account belonging to Dagalo. Meta told the AP in an email that the group had violated its Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy but did not provide any further details.\\nOn its website, Meta says the policy aims to clamp down on “organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence.”\\nIn a statement sent to the AP on Monday, the RSF said the closure of the accounts infringes on peoples right to impartial information.\\n‘’The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are allowed to disseminate graphic violence on their page while the RSF’s call for democracy and freedom is silenced,’’ the paramilitary said.\\nAs of Monday, the paramilitary and Dagalo still had active accounts on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.'),\n",

Their Thursday game was postponed until Saturday, when temperatures will be in the low 70s. He\\'s following all the safety tips.\\n\"It\\'s kind of weird to talk to him about it, but you\\'re just like \\'Hey, when you come home from practice, and you go, take a look at it, and look at the gauge to kind of see where you are,\"\\nThe girls\\' and boys\\' soccer teams at Providence Catholic have moved their practices indoors on Wednesday and Thursday.\\nCoach Michael Taylor was taking extra steps ahead of that on Tuesday.\\n\"We went to shortened practice. We made sure that the kids had water every 8 to 10 minutes. The drills that we did were very lighthearted. Lots of rests paired in between,\" Taylor said.\\nChicago Public Schools announced Tuesday they also are taking measures to stay cool; postponing all athletic games on Wednesday and Thursday, and cancelling practices or moving them indoors, because much like at Joliet Catholic, preparation is key.\\n\"Just being smart. It\\'s not worth it. Long season, trying to be as smart as possible,\" Lenahan said.\\nThe message for both Joliet Catholic and CPS is the same: stay hydrated now to be ready for this week.\\nCPS students received 12,000 donated bottles of water to ensure that happens.'),\n",

       "  'Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston was ruled not guilty of an Australian charge of concealing his father\\'s child sex crimes on Thursday.\\nHouston, 69, was the Sydney-based church\\'s senior global pastor when police charged him two years ago with concealing a serious indictable offense. He resigned from his church roles months later. At the time, the megachurch said an internal probe into allegations of inappropriate behavior revealed that Houston \"breached the Hillsong Pastor\\'s Code of Conduct.\"\\nSydney Magistrate Gareth Christofi ruled Brian Houston had a reasonable excuse for not reporting Frank Houston\\'s offenses to police. Christofi accepted that Houston believed the victim, Brett Sengstock, did not want the abuse in the 1970s reported to police.\\nSengstock testified in the trial that began in December that he never told Houston not to report the abuse.\\nSengstock told reporters outside court that the verdict blamed him for the church\\'s failure to report the elder Houston to police.\\n\"Frank Houston was no pioneer for Christianity. His legacy remains a faded memory of a pedophile,\" Sengstock told reporters.\\n\"Regardless of today\\'s outcome, I have received a life sentence. Blaming the victim is as repulsive as the assaults themselves,\" Sengstock added.\\nThe magistrate said that regardless of what Sengstock told Houston, Houston had been told of Sengstock\\'s attitude by others.\\n\"Victims of sexual abuse ought to feel safe to confide in others without being concerned they are exposing those others to a criminal offense,\" Christofi said.\\nHouston appeared teary-eyed when he spoke to media outside court.\\n\"I want to express my sadness to Brett Sengstock, genuine sadness about what my father did to him and all his victims. He was obviously a serial pedophile. We probably will never know the extent of his pedophilia,\" Houston told reporters.\\n\"A lot of people\\'s lives have been tragically hurt and for that I\\'ll always be very sad. But I\\'m not my father,\" he added.\\nHillsong is a global church with 30 locations around the world. On its website, Hillsong says it averages about 150,000 attendees weekly.\\nHillsong acknowledged the ruling in a statement from the church.\\n\"Our prayer is that those impacted deeply and irrevocably by the actions of Frank Houston will find peace and healing, and that our former senior pastor Brian Houston and his family can look to the future and continue to fulfill God\\'s purpose for their lives,\" it said.\\nHouston became aware in 1999 of his father\\'s abuse of the then-7-year-old Sengstock. His father confessed and was defrocked as an Assemblies of God pastor. Frank Houston died in 2004 at age 82 without being charged.\\nBrian Houston shared information about his father\\'s crimes with church leaders but not with police.\\nProsecutor Dareth Harrison said Houston had found a convenient excuse to avoid reporting the allegation to authorities to protect both the church and his father.\\nChristofi said proving that motivation beyond reasonable doubt was a \"tall order indeed.\"\\nProsecutors also submitted that Brian Houston had used vague language when he spoke publicly about his father\\'s abuse and removal as a minister.\\nChristofi found that while Brian Houston might have used euphemisms in public, his meaning was obvious and speaking \"widely and freely\" about his father\\'s abuse indicated Houston wanted people to know, the magistrate said.\\n\"That is the very opposite of a cover-up,\" Christofi said.\\nThe charge followed the findings of an Australian government inquiry published in 2015 into institutional responses to allegations of child sex abuse.\\nThe inquiry found Frank Houston had been allowed to retire quietly in response to his crimes. Brian Houston had faced a potential 5-year prison sentence if convicted.\\nThe allegations of inappropriate behavior that were investigated by an internal probe were two instances over 10 years, CBS News has previously reported. In one complaint, Houston was accused of sending \"inappropriate text messages\" to a member of the church\\'s staff. Hillsong said Houston was dependent on sleeping pills and under the influence at the time, and that Houston \"immediately\" apologized. The staff member later resigned.\\nThe second complaint alleged that Houston had knocked on the door \"of a hotel room that was not his\" at a Hillsong conference, entered the room, and spent time with the \"female occupant.\" Hillsong said the pastor \"became disoriented\" before the incident due to consuming a higher-than-prescribed dose of anti-anxiety medication and alcohol. Details of the incident were unable to be sustained, the church said, but \"the conduct was of serious concern.\"\\nHouston was reportedly agreed to carry out a series of measures after the probe, but by late 2021, the church said it had to take \"further measures.\"\\nHouston did not mention these misconduct claims when he announced his departure from the church in January 2022, only saying he was leaving to focus on the charges brought against him by the Australian court.\\nIn recent years, Hillsong has been the subject of documentaries on networks that include Hulu and TLC.'),\n",

       "  'An actor who went viral online after she posted a tearful tweet about performing her one-woman show to an audience of one at the Edinburgh festival fringe has played to a sell out crowd only 24 hours later.\\nThe actor and writer Georgie Grier received messages of support from comedians including Jason Manford and Dara Ó Briain when she posted on Twitter on Thursday afternoon: “There was one person in my audience today when I performed my one-woman play, ‘Sunsets’ at #edfringe. It’s fine, isn’t it? It’s fine …?”\\nThe Gilded Balloon, where Grier is performing Sunsets, confirmed on Friday afternoon that the show had sold out.\\nGrier reportedly emerged on stage with the words “Hello Wembley” on Friday lunchtime, before launching into her show, billed as a play about romantic comedies and set during a live podcast recording.\\nOn Friday night, she said: “What a wild start to my Fringe experience. From one audience member yesterday to a personalised video from Jason Manford, thousands of supportive messages on social media and seeing more faces in the audience today; it’s been a whirlwind 24 hours. When I posted, I was hoping for a few messages of support or advice from fellow Fringe acts, however I had no idea how much it would resonate with people.\\n“There are ups and downs every day (every hour) at the Fringe but ultimately I know I’m lucky to be performing here. The reaction and support from everybody including my family, friends, the staff at my venue, Gilded Balloon, people online and other performers has lifted my spirits, but I know there are still no guarantees.”\\nHer plaintive posting on Thursday, which has so far gained 5m views, elicited a deluge of sympathetic responses.\\nÓ Briain, the host of Mock the Week, replied: “We’ve ALL done it. Soon, you’ll dine out on this anecdote. More than once I had to buy my audience a drink, as a thank you for being the only ones there.\\n“Best thing though, it’s all stage time, and the show will get better every single time, ready for the big crowds later!”\\nFringe veteran Manford responded with a video message, recalling his own Edinburgh agonies handing out flyers in the rain.\\nManford told Grier: “It’s absolutely normal … for one person to rock up to your show, especially at the beginning of Edinburgh, and also for you to be a bit upset or annoyed or pissed off about it. That’s totally fine as well.\\n“I did Edinburgh in 2004-5 and I remember [the] first couple of shows, the first week I think, was just, it was such a slog and I was out in the rain and I was flyering and people weren’t coming.\\n“I got total impostor syndrome. How much is this costing me? What am I doing here? Look at all these amazing people. How embarrassing that … nobody’s turned up but, you know what, you’re on the path and it’s just the start, that’s all.”\\nEven the Tory peer Daniel Finkelstein was moved to respond, saying: “I went to Norwich to give a speech and it took me 4hrs of travel. There were only 2 people there.\\n“One of them was the person who invited me. I asked the other person to join the cause I was there to support. He said he would, but it might interfere with the terms of his parole.”\\nMeanwhile the single audience member from Grier’s Thursday show has come forward to say that she “smashed” the performance.\\nSophie Craig, 32, told the PA news agency that Grier “should be so proud of herself”.\\nCraig, an actor and comedian who is performing her first show at the Fringe, said: “Georgie and I had connected on Instagram, because I think she asked a question about the industry or something like that, and then we were like, ‘Oh, we’re both taking shows up [to Edinburgh]. We’ll come and support each other’. She came and supported my show and I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll come and see yours, of course I will’, so I booked it.”\\nCraig, who is performing in I Love You, Now What? at the festival, said her fellow actor “gave it everything” and the performance “wasn’t any different to how she would be if she was performing to a full house”.\\n“It’s just so incredibly brave. Bringing a show up to the Fringe on your own, especially as a female and a new writer, is incredibly hard and she just smashed it.”'),\n",

It gave me a sense of relief.\\nI further reassured myself when I read a brushfire, which ignited in Lāhainā at around 6:30 a.m., had been declared 100% contained by 9 a.m. — a feat accomplished well before I\\'d even woken up.\\nI continued checking for updates about the fire throughout the day but didn\\'t see many. I\\'d convinced myself that my family and hometown were out of harm\\'s way — it seemed like the situation in Lāhainā was under control.\\nI didn\\'t know it yet, but a few hours later would be the beginning of an unprecedented journey that would test my personal resilience, deepen my community connections, and showcase the indomitable spirit of Hawaii.\\nMy worries came rushing back within a few hours as friends began getting in touch with me\\nEverything changed when I received a text from another friend and neighbor just after 4 p.m., informing me that the fire in Lāhainā had reignited. It wasn\\'t contained, she wrote. \"The fire is bad here.\"\\nFifteen minutes later, another friend who lives on a houseboat in Lāhainā sent me photos of a thick cloud of black smoke looming over the town.\\nI was struck with a sense of urgency. I grew desperate to ensure my parents\\' safety, contact our neighbors, and relay the whereabouts of my important documents and sentimental items in their home.\\nBut cell service hadn\\'t gotten any better and my attempts to reach my parents remained futile.\\nAt last, at 8:30 p.m., I received a call from my mom through a family friend\\'s phone. My parents had successfully evacuated.\\nSleep that night was elusive. Outside my living-room window, flames flickered in the distance, signaling the ongoing battle of fires Upcountry and in Kīhei.\\nThe fire had destroyed decades of memories and my family\\'s livelihood\\nAt 6:30 a.m. the next morning, my parents finally made it to my apartment. While I was relieved to see them, they came with devastating news.\\n\"I think we lost the house,\" my mom said.\\nA few hours later, we poured over aerial footage of Lāhainā and were able to confirm that our home had been reduced to smoldering rubble.\\nThis was the house I grew up in, where my dad had lived for the past 46 years. He\\'d left thinking they\\'d be able to go back and that smoke damage would be their main grievance.\\nBut everything that had been left behind was gone: remnants of my childhood — the majority of my baby photos and videos, a stuffed animal I\\'ve cherished since I was 2 years old, letters my dad wrote me from before I was born to the day he dropped me off at my college dorm, heirloom jewelry from both of my grandmothers.\\nIt wasn\\'t our only loss.

But there is skepticism and concern about the government following through after years of broken promises and delays.\\nCYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENTS, DOCTORS CELEBRATE FDA\\'S \\'LIFE-CHANGING\\' APPROVAL OF NEW TREATMENT\\nJames Bounds, a retired coal miner from Oak Hill, West Virginia, said nothing can be done to reverse the debilitating illness he was diagnosed with at 37 in 1984. But he doesn\\'t want others to suffer the same fate.\\n\"It’s not going to help me — I’m through mining,\" said Bounds, 75, who now uses supplemental oxygen to breathe. \"But we don’t want these young kids breathing like we do.\"\\nThe rule, published in the Federal Register this month, cuts the permissible exposure limit for silica dust from 100 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air for an 8-hour shift in coal, metal and nonmetal mines such as sand and gravel.\\nThe proposal is in line with exposure levels imposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on construction and other non-mining industries. And it’s the standard The Centers for Disease Control was recommending as far back as 1974.\\nSilicosis is an occupational pneumoconiosis caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica dust present in minerals like sandstone. The U.S. Department of Labor began studying silica and its impact on workers’ health in the 1930s, but the focus on stopping exposure in the workplace largely bypassed coal miners.\\nInstead, regulations centered on coal dust, a separate hazard created by crushing or pulverizing coal rock that also contributes to black lung.\\nIn the decades since, silica dust has become a major problem as Appalachian miners cut through layers of sandstone to reach less accessible coal seams in mountaintop mines where coal closer to the surface has long been tapped. Silica dust is 20 times more toxic than coal dust and causes severe forms of black lung disease even after a few years of exposure.\\nAn estimated one in five tenured miners in Central Appalachia has black lung disease; one in 20 has the most disabling form of black lung.\\nMiners are also being diagnosed at younger ages — some in their 30s and others with the advanced kind in their 40s. \"That’s just nuts,\" said Dr. Carl Werntz, a West Virginia physician who conducts black lung examinations and described cases as \"skyrocketing.\"\\nUnited Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts said there\\'s no reason a 35-year-old miner should be diagnosed with a disease \"that\\'s going to cost him his life.\"\\n\"Nobody should be dying because of a job they have,\" Roberts said.\\nMSHA’s existing silica standards were developed in the 1970s, around the time of the U.S. Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.\\nWest Virginia University law professor Pat McGinley, who was part of a state team investigating the 2010 Upper Big Branch mining disaster that killed 29 miners, called the resurgence of black lung \"unparalleled\" when it comes to occupational health failures. In the Upper Big Branch mine, 71% of the 24 miners who received autopsies were found to have black lung.\\nFIRST AI-GENERATED DRUG ENTERS HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS, TARGETING CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE PATIENTS\\n\"I can’t think of any occupation where there has been such devastation that’s been ignored\" by corporations and the government, he said. \"It\\'s stunning.\"\\nThe new rule is supported by Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia, who pushed for the change and released a joint statement saying protecting miners from \"dangerous levels of silica cannot wait.\"\\nMSHA will be collecting comments on the proposal through Aug. 28, with three hearings scheduled in Arlington, Virginia, Beckley, West Virginia, and Denver.\\nOne issue expected to come up: the use of respiratory protection equipment.\\nThe National Mining Association, which represents mine operators, wants workers to be permitted to use respirators as a method of compliance with the rule.\\n\"These are recognized industrial hygiene practices utilized by″ federal regulators in other industries, \"but not in mining,″ spokesman Conor Bernstein said, adding that better ventilation controls, safety awareness and regulations on coal dust have all contributed to \"exponentially lower dust levels\" inside U.S. mines in recent years.\\nThe mine workers\\' union and others, however, say respirators are ineffective while performing heavy labor in hot, confined spaces common in mines. The proposed rule allows for the use of respirators on a temporary basis while operators are implementing engineering controls. But advocates say inspectors aren\\'t present often enough to ensure they don\\'t become a permanent solution.\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\"The history of miner safety and health enforcement teaches us that exceptions become the rule,\" said Sam Petsonk, a West Virginia attorney who represented miners who were diagnosed with black lung after operators knowingly violated regulations.\\nThe proposed rule also includes a provision that allows companies to self-report silica levels. Federal inspectors conduct spot checks to ensure accuracy, but mine operators still have leeway to manipulate reporting data, said Willie Dodson, Central Appalachian field coordinator for Appalachian Voices, an advocacy group.\\n\"Ideally, MSHA inspectors would take samples day after day after day in a given mine to determine compliance,″ he said.\\nA coal dust examiner who worked for a Kentucky mining company was sentenced to six months in prison last month for falsifying dust samples and lying to federal officials.\\nIn rural Nickelsville, Virginia, near the Tennessee border, Vonda Robinson says miners and their families are owed more accountability from the federal government and mine operators. Her husband John was diagnosed with black lung about a decade ago at 47. Now, his doctors say he will need a lung transplant.\\nVonda Robinson said her husband doesn\\'t know what to say when his 5-year-old granddaughter asks why he can\\'t run and play with her, why even walking down the end of the driveway leaves him physically spent.\\n\"He’ll tell her ‘Honey, papaw can\\'t do that,\\' \" she said.\\nDuring his 28 years mining, John Robinson would come home with his face covered with dust. But she tried not to worry. Everyone in the community mined coal.\\n\"He was one of those that wanted to go in the mines to give his family the American dream — the nice house, vehicles, put our kids through college,\" she said. \"And this is what he got.\"'),\n",

But the Korea Times reported Friday that multiple embassies in Seoul are on “high alert,” scrambling to make sure Scouts from their countries are safe.\\nAbout 700 American Boy Scouts have traveled to South Korea for the event, and U.S. Embassy officials said they had been in touch with both the Boy Scouts of America and the U.S. military command in South Korea over the status of the U.S. contingent.\\nPHOTOS: British scouts to leave South Korean Jamboree site after 100 participants suffer heat ailments\\nThe news from the site, in southwestern Korea, is a jolt for a nation renowned globally as a safe pair of hands when it comes to organizing international events — including a previous World Scout Jamboree in 1991.\\nAbout 40,000 Scouts from 158 nations around the world have gathered in Saemangeum, on South Korea’s Yellow Sea coast south of Seoul. Jamborees are held every four years, and the current one runs through Aug. 12.\\nBut alarming media reports and social media complaints from worried parents indicate the great adventure is mutating into a great trial.\\nSome TV reports showcase grinning Scouts saying they are making the best of the weather, which is topping 95 degrees Fahrenheit. But Saemangeum, a reclaimed site, is a largely featureless landscape lacking natural shade, pushing temperatures inside tents even higher.\\nOther footage shows Scouts hefting umbrellas as they line up in the sun for facilities, and flooding convenience stores to buy ice and ice cream.\\nMobile showers have backed up, with mud covering the floors. Participants say the number of on-site toilets is insufficient, as are cleaning staff. Swarms of insects have descended, and though Korean mosquitoes are not malarial, gruesome images show legs covered in sores from bites.\\nIn medical centers, staffers’ inability to speak English has generated further criticism.\\nMobilizing from the top\\nIn the face of harshly critical media reports, the South Korean government is mobilizing from the very top: President Yoon Suk Yeol has ordered the dispatch of air-conditioned buses and freezer vans, and demanded improvements in the food.\\nThe army is on call. Some 40 military medical personnel are on-site, and engineers are reportedly setting up more washing facilities and sunshades.\\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo convened an emergency Cabinet meeting that approved the release of $5.28 million in funds.\\nThe Foreign Ministry announced the establishment of a task force to coordinate with embassies anxious about the well-being of their nationals in Saemangeum.\\n“Some of the participating governments have officially expressed concerns on the condition of the event, and some parents of international participants are complaining through social network services,” Yun Jae-ok, floor leader of the ruling People Power Party, said at a National Assembly meeting, the Korea Times reported.\\nMr. Yun fretted that South Korea’s national image — as a well-governed economic and cultural powerhouse — could be damaged by the episode.\\n“The atmosphere towards Korea is becoming increasingly positive worldwide, and this Jamboree should not be an experience they want to forget,” he said.\\nThe fallout is extraordinary given that Seoul has made the successful hosting of top-level international events a cornerstone of South Korea’s brand.\\nSouth Korea hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics, the 2002 World Cup and the 2018 Winter Olympics, all praised for their spare-no-expenses, superlative organization. Likewise, the country hosted the 1991 Scout Jamboree successfully.\\nThe 1991 event, however, was held in the lush, forested hills of a national park in the country’s northeast. The 2023 event is being held on a flat, reclaimed estuary on the west coast, behind the world’s biggest sea wall.\\n“Seamanguem is not known for its visual beauty and seems a very odd choice at this time of year, at peak heat,” said Michael Breen, author of “The New Koreans.” “It seems a serious misjudgment, and I expect the decision was made by someone who has never slept in a tent.”\\nSaemangeum is in Korea’s southwestern Jeolla province, customarily considered a hard-luck area.\\nThe World Organization of the Scouting Movement, the global umbrella organization, said in a statement Friday it had appealed to South Korean organizers “to consider alternative options to wind down the event earlier than scheduled, and support participants until they depart for their home countries. The host decided to proceed with the delivery of the event with assurances that they will do their utmost to tackle the issues caused by the heat wave by adding significant additional resources.”\\n“We continue to call on the host and the Korean government to follow through on their commitments to mobilize additional financial and human resources, and to make the health and safety of participants their highest priority,” the statement said.'),\n",

The NCAA shut down official visits to campus by high school prospects in all sports and banned coaches from taking recruiting trips for more than a year because of COVID-19.\\nSeveral assistants resigned or were fired due to the investigation.\\nArizona State fired Edwards three games into last season, his fifth with the program, and gave him a $4.4 million buyout instead of firing him for cause. Former Oregon offensive coordinator Kenny Dillingham was hired as his replacement.\\nThe ban is a big hit to the new coaching staff and more than 50 new players who were not a part of the program when the alleged infractions occurred.\\n“Like I told the guys: you can’t control it,” Dillingham said after practice Sunday. “Not one person in the country feels bad for us.

This time, it came from agencies in the U.S., where more than half of the population was subject to heat warnings at one point during the last month.\\nOn Monday, officials at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration unveiled new data indicating that July was the hottest month on record, with both global sea-surface and land temperatures soaring well above longstanding averages. According to NOAA and NASA, Earth in 2023 saw its warmest July since temperature record-keeping began 174 years ago.\\nSince July is climatologically the hottest month of the year, this year\\'s numbers likely mean it was the hottest month on record overall, NOAA said in a news release. In a separate release issued Tuesday, NASA said scientists at its Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York determined that \"July 2023 was hotter than any other month in the global temperature record.\"\\nThe data came on the heels of a similar report released earlier in August by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a branch of the European Union\\'s space program. That report also identified July 2023 as Earth\\'s hottest month on record, noting that the global monthly temperature was unusually higher than average. July was so hot that officials at the United Nations announced it would likely break the planet\\'s monthly record before July was even over. Later reports by the European climate agency and now by agencies in the U.S. have reinforced those suspicions.\\nGlobally, the surface temperature on Earth in July was 2.02 degrees Fahrenheit greater than the 20th century\\'s average temperature, which was 60.4 degrees Fahrenheit, data shows. It marked the first July in recorded history where the temperature exceeded 1.8 degrees above the long-term average, according to NOAA, which noted that the latest temperature record was also 0.36 degrees warmer than the previous July record, set in 2021.\\n\"July 2023 marked the 47th-consecutive July and the 533rd-consecutive month with temperatures at least nominally above the 20th-century average,\" the agency said.\\nThis past July also marked the fourth consecutive month where global ocean surface temperatures reached a new record high, owing in part to the onset of El Niño, a recurring climate pattern determined by sea surface temperatures and precipitation levels across the equatorial Pacific. NOAA announced the arrival of El Niño, the \"warm phase\" of the climate cycle that replaces its counterpart, La Niña, in June. Also in June, the agency observed a record-high sea surface temperature, which was then topped by another anomaly seen in July — the latter measurement ultimately resulted in the highest monthly sea surface temperature anomaly in NOAA\\'s 174-year record.\\nAccording to data collected by NASA, the five hottest Julys since the agency started tracking temperatures in 1880 have happened in the last five years. This year\\'s record-breaking heat hit certain parts of the globe harder than others, with portions of South America, North Africa, North America and the Arctic Peninsula experiencing especially blistering weather. In those places, July temperatures in 2023 stood at about 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit above average, NASA said, attributing the phenomena mostly to the ongoing consequences of human-caused climate change.\\n\"NASA data confirms what billions around the world literally felt: temperatures in July 2023 made it the hottest month on record.

A mug shot for the mayor who probably put the worst criminal of the 20th century in jail,” Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, complained to reporters when he left his apartment to travel to Atlanta.\\nThe indictment alleges that Giuliani was a key part of a criminal conspiracy, pressing election officials in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania to act on voting fraud claims he was repeatedly told were false. Giuliani was also charged with promoting false claims that voting machines were rigged and making false claims in sworn legal filings.\\nIn addition, the indictment singles out false claims Giuliani made about Georgia election worker Ruby Freeman, who was targeted with death threats and harassed as a result of the phony allegations.\\nGiuliani is being represented by New York-based attorney John Esposito, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney.\\nThe main charge against Giuliani — racketeering — is similar to a federal law he used with great success when he was U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\\nGiuliani predicted Wednesday that he will be vindicated. “This will be proven to be like all the rest, a complete hoax and a lie,” he said.'),\n",

He and fellow no campaign leader, the Coalition senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, spoke on the conference’s first day on Saturday but were not present on Sunday.\\nAfter Marks spoke, an announcement over the loudspeaker at CPAC explained the name “Chaim Tsibos” was meant as a play on “I’m the boss”. The announcement told attenders to check the website comedian.com.au for more information.\\nThe website is owned by a Rodney Marks, who is credited as a corporate comedian promising “funny keynote speeches that are almost believable”.\\n“Rodney has a growing repertoire of over 350 characters, with numerous accents and dialects, from hundreds of professions,” the website states.\\n“He is a corporate impostor – a comic hoax speaker in a business suit.”\\nMarks’ 25-minute address to CPAC, which regularly drew large amounts of laughter and applause from the crowd, also joked that “Closing the Gap” should be the name of Sydney’s suicide prevention program. Closing the Gap is the federal Indigenous health and welfare program seeking to close gaps in life expectancy and other outcomes.\\nMarks also mocked the Barbie movie, asking the audience: “Is Barbie even a woman? Her only hole is in her head.”\\nMundine founded the Recognise A Better Way organisation, one of several groups opposing the referendum. Johns, the former Labor minister, is now president of that organisation.\\nIn his speech to CPAC on Sunday morning, Johns called for greater “integration” of Indigenous communities.\\n“If you’re not trying to get those people either out of that remote community or out of the stupor in which they live, or give them the tools to allow them adapt to life in the modern world, the world we inherited, then you’re doing wrong,” he said.\\n“Being practical is not the answer. You have to do practical things in the name of integration.”\\nJohns then claimed to quote the father of Nampijinpa Price.\\n“As Dave Price, Jacinta’s dad, has said to me often enough: ‘If you want a voice, learn English. That’s your voice,’” he said.\\nJohns last month rejected calls to resign from his position in the no campaign after he was criticised for suggesting Indigenous people should undergo blood tests to access welfare benefits.\\nThe arguments were made in his recent book titled The Burden of Culture. That book was on sale in the lobby of the CPAC conference on a table alongside other titles including ones authored by Mundine.\\nHanson-Young, a yes supporter, tweeted that Johns’ speech was “nasty rubbish”.\\n“Will Mr Dutton condemn the latest racist rant from the no campaign? There can be no fence sitters in this vote. Either you think this nasty rubbish is OK or you don’t,” she said.\\n“Each of us has a choice. You’re with the nasties voting no, or you believe Australia can be better and vote yes.”'),\n",

       "  'Retreats from crumbling empires are inevitably characterised by hastily arranged evacuations. Panicked civilians make their way to rickety airport terminals, in the hope of an emergency flight out of the chaos. This was the postcolonial scene in Niamey, the capital of Niger, this week, as hundreds of French nationals joined other EU citizens in scurrying away from the west African nation.\\nSections of the military had staged a coup against Mohamed Bazoum, Niger’s democratically elected president, just before 3 August, the country’s National Day, when it marked 63 years since gaining nominal independence from France in 1960.\\nCrowds were chanting “Down with France” as they targeted the country’s embassy last weekend, smashing windows and setting fire to perimeter walls. As Bazoum remained under house arrest, his close allies in Paris feared that the safety of westerners could no longer be guaranteed. A bullish statement from the Élysée Palace vowed that Emmanuel Macron “will not tolerate any attack against France and its interests”. If anybody was hurt, retaliation would come “immediately and uncompromisingly”, said Macron, sounding every inch the imperial master issuing a stark warning to unruly natives causing trouble more than 2,000 miles away.\\nDespite the illusion of complete withdrawal, France still has a garrison of 1,500 troops in Niger, together with an air force base servicing fighter jets and attack drones. All of this is a forceful reminder that, in spite of a long and bloody period of decolonisation, France has retained a quasi-empire in Africa by stealth, and it is under threat like never before.\\nThe current Niger crisis can thus be linked to former colonial relationships being restructured as Françafrique – a formidable neocolonial nexus across sub-Saharan Africa encompassing economic, political, security and cultural ties and alliances centred on the French language and values.\\nCharles de Gaulle, France’s most influential postwar president, summed up its importance by saying: “French world power and French power in Africa were inextricably linked and mutually confirming.” While recognising self-determination movements, De Gaulle and subsequent French leaders wanted to hold on to their strategic military bases, as well as energy resources and favourable trade deals, along with financial control.\\nThose leaders all viewed Africa as France’s pré carré, or backyard – a metaphor dating back to the pre-revolutionary monarchs to refer to conquered territory that needed defending. Niger, for example, is the world’s seventh-largest uranium producer, and France, which relies on nuclear energy for around 70% of its power, is a key importer.\\nMilitary and governmental advisers from Paris have permeated successive Nigerien administrations too, not least the one that has just been deposed. Crucially, French remains the official language for 25 million Nigeriens, and cultural organisations within the Francophonie group of nations – those united by the language of Molière – abound.\\nBeyond this, outright corruption has also played a part in maintaining the postcolonial order. Françafrique has comprised countries notorious for human rights violations, including Niger. Subservient puppet leaders ignored democratic progress in return for massive aid programmes. Bribes have been paid via arms deals and other help with security, and – of course – in hard cash that has been laundered.\\nThe money flow was always two-way, as Africans also provided suitcases full of cash to senior French politicians. Former president Nicolas Sarkozy, already a convicted criminal, has been charged with accepting millions from the late Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, for example. He denies the accusation.\\nThe most enduring legacy of Gallic colonialism is the CFA (African Financial Community) franc – a currency once pegged to the French franc, and now to the euro. It gives France monetary hegemony over several African states, including Niger.\\nThe US has always supported such exploitative arrangements, originally because former French colonies were seen as bastions against the geopolitical and ideological influence of the Soviet Union during the cold war. The notion of France being the “Gendarme of Africa” now extends to it playing a vital role in the fight against terrorist insurgents such as al-Qaida in the vast Sahel region, which straddles around a dozen countries from Eritrea to Senegal, via Niger.\\nFrance’s big problem, however, is that Nigeriens – like so many Africans – are rejecting Françafrique with as much fervour as their forebears came to reject the official French Empire. In this sense, France’s traditional dominance is disintegrating.\\nDespite receiving up to $2bn a year in development assistance, Niger remains one of the poorest countries on earth, with a literacy rate of just 37%. The EU was due to allocate €503m to Niger in the three years up to 2024, but the ongoing influence of France and its allies is still blamed for endemic problems, including mass youth unemployment.\\nNiger is only the latest country in the region to undergo a coup, after Mali in 2020 and 2021 and Burkina Faso (twice) in 2022 – both former colonies that also gained independence from France in 1960. All express increasing resentment towards the French, and indeed the west, while rival powers including Russia, Turkey and China threaten to exploit the situation.\\nJuntas in Burkina Faso and Mali have already warned that any attempt to restore Bazoum in Niger via military intervention will be viewed as a declaration of war. Troops working for Wagner, the Russian mercenary group, are meanwhile operating within Niger’s neighbours, and have offered their support to the rebellious Nigeriens.\\nRussian flags were brandished by those demonstrating outside the French embassy in Niamey, with many calling for Vladimir Putin to replace Macron as their biggest global backer. This raises the prospect of a new “scramble for Africa” – the classic description of the way European powers annexed chunks of the continent up until the first world war. If – as seems likely – hatred of France intensifies, then there is every possibility of full-blown evacuations, to include French soldiers, as the key Françafrique nations of sub-Saharan Africa finally complete the decolonisation process.\\nThe most welcome outcome of all this would be for Niger and other African states on a similar path to choose self-government and a democratic future – but it is more probable that countries with even worse records for corruption, human rights abuses and all-round mismanagement will step in to fill the power vacuum.'),\n",

       "  'MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Manchester City signed Croatia center-back Joško Gvardiol from Leipzig for 90 million euros ($99.2 million) on Saturday, ranking him among the most expensive defenders in soccer history.\\nThe 21-year-old Gvardiol, known as “Little Pep” because of his name’s likeness to City manager Pep Guardiola, is one of the most highly rated defenders in the world and enhanced his reputation with impressive performances for Croatia at the World Cup last year.\\nHe signed a five-year contract with City, which won a treble of trophies last season: the Premier League title, Champions League and FA Cup.\\n“Anyone who saw Manchester City play last season knows they are the best team in the world,” Gvardiol said. “To win the treble says everything you need to know about the quality this team has. To be joining City is something very special for me and my family.”\\nAt Leipzig, Gvardiol won the German Cup in back-to-back seasons and played in the Champions League.\\nThe transfer fee puts him among the likes of Manchester United’s Harry Maguire, who cost 80 million pounds (then $97 million) when he joined from Leicester in 2019, and Virgil van Dijk, who moved from Southampton to Liverpool for 75 million pounds (then $100 million) in 2018.\\n“He is a player we have watched closely, and we feel he has a superb set of attributes,” City director of football Txiki Begiristain said. “Top clubs all over Europe have been monitoring him, so to bring him here is great news for us.\\n“Josko has so many qualities — everything you want in a centre-half. He is fast, competitive, combative, strong in the air, impressive in possession of the ball, with strong self-belief and a good character. He is left-footed, too, which offers us good options at the back.”\\nGvardiol would likely play on the left side of City’s back three, if Guardiola persists with the 3-2-4-1 formation he deployed in the second half of last season.\\nCity also has Nathan Ake for that role in a formation that essentially sees the team play a defense full of center backs and dispense with full backs.\\n“To have the chance to work with Pep Guardiola, too, will be amazing for me,” Gvardiol said. “I know I am not yet the finished article and I am sure my game will progress under the best coach in football.”\\nGvardiol is City’s second signing of the offseason, after Croatia teammate Mateo Kovacic, who replaced Ilkay Gundogan in the squad. Gundogan, City’s captain last season, has joined Barcelona, and winger Riyad Mahrez moved to Saudi Arabia with Al-Ahli.\\nLeipzig will be losing a third key player this offseason, having sold playmaker Dominik Szoboszlai to Liverpool and forward Christopher Nkunku to Chelsea. Highly rated young Slovenian striker Benjamin Šeško is joining Leipzig for the new season.\\n___'),\n",

A judge could decide to go beyond the guidance when he sentences her on Oct. 27.\\nAs part of a plea deal, a separate charge — a misdemeanor count of recklessly leaving a loaded firearm so as to endanger a child — was dropped, allowing Taylor to avoid a potential six-year prison sentence.\\nJames Ellenson, a lawyer for the family, said Taylor remains remorseful, although he believes no prison time would be the appropriate sentence.\\n\"She feels very responsible, feels very bad,\" Ellenson told reporters after the hearing.\\n\"It\\'s just very emotional, the whole hearing,\" he added. \"It\\'s all just very upsetting to everybody.\"\\nThe court hearing in Newport News ended one facet of the case, which drew national attention to school safety and gun violence and led to the ouster of the school\\'s superintendent and an assistant principal.\\nAbigail Zwerner, the teacher in the shooting at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News, was seriously wounded but survived.\\nCourt documents unsealed this month included new details in how the boy, who is identified only by his initials, obtained the 9 mm semi-automatic handgun.\\nOn Jan. 6, the morning of the shooting, Taylor believed the gun was in her purse with the trigger lock installed and left on top of her bedroom dresser, according to a probable cause statement. She added that the key for the lock is kept under her bedroom mattress.\\nNewport News police have said that the gun was legally purchased but that they were investigating whether it was properly secured as the child\\'s family has claimed.\\nEllenson has said Taylor believes the gun was placed on a high closet shelf with a trigger lock. But he acknowledged in May that questions still remain about how the child accessed the weapon.\\n\"People have talked to him about that, but I don\\'t know that any adult knows exactly how he got the gun,\" Ellenson told ABC News.\\nAs part of the investigation, Taylor also pleaded guilty in federal court in June to the use of marijuana while possessing a firearm. She is expected to be sentenced in October and could receive 18 months to 24 months in prison.\\nThe narcotics were discovered during a court-ordered search of the home in connection with the shooting, federal prosecutors said. Under U.S. law, it is illegal to use marijuana while possessing a firearm.\\n\"A search of Taylor\\'s phone revealed numerous text messages illustrating the pervasive scope of Taylor\\'s marijuana use,\" according to prosecutors. Meanwhile, \"a lockbox was not found in either of the residences, nor was a trigger lock or key to a trigger lock ever found.\"\\nAs part of a care plan at the school, the boy\\'s parents were supposed to be with him daily, but were absent on the day of the shooting, officials said.\\nThe unsealed court documents say police arrived at the classroom to find the gun and cartridge casings lying on the floor. School staff members were rendering aid to Zwerner, who was shot in her left hand and upper chest.\\nAnother teacher told police that the children had returned from recess when she heard a gunshot as she walked by. Children fled from the classroom followed by a wounded Zwerner. The other teacher went in and saw the 6-year-old standing by his desk, and she held him until police arrived, according to the documents.\\nAt Taylor\\'s hearing, prosecutors said that her son was reportedly combative as he was being detained, saying, \"F--- you. I shot my teacher,\" before breaking free and punching a staffer.\\nHe also said, \"I got my mom\\'s gun last night. My mom had that,\" and \"I stole it because I needed to shoot my teacher,\" according to prosecutors.\\nThe child\\'s family has said that he has an \"acute disability\" and that he had received the \"treatment he needs\" under a court-ordered temporary detention at a medical facility.\\nHe is under the care of Taylor\\'s grandfather, who attended Tuesday\\'s plea hearing.\\n\"The child is doing fine. He\\'s progressing,\" Ellenson said.\\nA prosecutor said in March that the 6-year-old would not face charges given that a child that young wouldn\\'t have the competency to understand the legal system or adequately assist an attorney.\\nZwerner has filed a $40 million lawsuit alleging that school administrators shrugged off multiple warnings from staff and students who believed the boy had a gun and posed an imminent threat on the day of the shooting, and did so knowing the child \"had a history of random violence.\"\\nThe Newport News Public Schools said in a statement this month that it cannot comment on legal actions, but that it has \"worked cooperatively\" with authorities and it \"remains committed to ensuring the well-being and care of all students and staff.\"\\nKyle Stewart reported from Newport News and Erik Ortiz from New York.')]"
